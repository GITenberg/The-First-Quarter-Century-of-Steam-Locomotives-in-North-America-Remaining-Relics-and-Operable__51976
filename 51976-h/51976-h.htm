<p class="pcap">Replica of the <b>Lafayette</b> (see <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>) as it appeared in the fall of
1955, during the making of a motion picture in northern Georgia.
For the picture, which was based on the story of the famous Civil
War locomotive <b>General</b> (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>), this &ldquo;One-Armed Billy&rdquo; of the
1830&rsquo;s was disguised as the <b>Yonah</b>, of the Cooper Iron Works Rail
Road, and is shown here as it was operating on the Tallulah Falls
Railway. (<i>Color plate contributed by Thomas Norrell.</i>)</p>

<h2>ADVERTISEMENT</h2>
<p>The scientific publications of the National Museum include two
series known, respectively, as <i>Proceedings</i> and <i>Bulletin</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Proceedings</i> series, begun in 1878, is intended primarily as a
medium for the publication of original papers based on the collections
of the National Museum, that set forth newly acquired facts in biology,
anthropology, and geology, with descriptions of new forms and revisions
of limited groups. Copies of each paper, in pamphlet form, are
distributed as published to libraries and scientific organizations and
to specialists and others interested in the different subjects. The dates
at which these separate papers are published are recorded in the table
of contents of each of the volumes.</p>
<p>The series of <i>Bulletins</i>, the first of which was issued in 1875, contains
separate publications comprising monographs of large zoological
groups and other general systematic treatises (occasionally in several
volumes), faunal works, reports of expeditions, catalogs of type specimens,
special collections, and other material of similar nature. The
majority of the volumes are octavo in size, but a quarto size has been
adopted in a few instances. In the <i>Bulletin</i> series appear volumes
under the heading <i>Contributions from the United States National Herbarium</i>,
in octavo form, published by the National Museum since 1902, which
contain papers relating to the botanical collections of the Museum.</p>
<p>The present work forms No. 210 of the <i>Bulletin</i> series.</p>

<br />The Vanishing Iron Horse</h2>
<p>As the midpoint of the 20th century was reached, the
curtain was falling upon the final phases of steam locomotive
operation in North America. Almost certainly, after
another decade there would remain in service comparatively
few representatives of the engine which had been the primary
source of motive power of the railroads for over a hundred
years.</p>
<p>In that comparatively short time the steam locomotive had
changed the United States from a small country with a few
seaports, and with towns and settlements little farther inland
than river navigation permitted, to a great nation covered
with cities and spanning a continent. It had made possible
the confederation of the isolated provinces of Canada into a
great Dominion. Now, by the 1950&rsquo;s, owing to the emergence
of another type of motive power, it had become
obsolete and its days could be numbered.</p>
<p>No future generation would experience the thrill enjoyed
by its predecessors. No future American could stand awed
beside the track and behold the majestic onrush of the iron
horse, be deafened by the blast of the exhaust, the crash and
clatter of steel on steel, and the hiss of escaping steam, or be
momentarily shaken as the locomotive thundered past in a
blurred flash of connecting rods, valve mechanism, and
pounding wheels.</p>
<p>No child at night would ever again awaken to the eerie
echo of a far-off steam whistle crying at a lonely crossing, or
by day look out from a hillside at the long white plume of
steam that marked a distant train charging down the valley
below. The present generation of Americans can gaze back
upon these things with nostalgia. The next will never know
them.</p>
<p>Here and there a steam engine will be saved, but the
people of a different era will note them and quickly pass on,
wondering. Only a few will pause to marvel and ponder over
the development of the steam locomotive.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>It is to the everlasting credit of our forebears that some
few examples and relics of the early engines have been preserved;
and the appearance of this study of them, coming in
the final hour of the steam locomotive, is most appropriate.
The author has gone to painstaking lengths to find and sift
and bring together the most complete record ever compiled
of these examples and relics remaining of the earliest of
North American railway engines and of working replicas of
them.</p>
<p>Students of locomotive and railroad history are familiar
with the almost impossible task confronting the researcher
who undertakes to trace the history of early engines. The
contemporary account is often a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp pursued
endlessly through the yellowed pages of century-old newspapers
and books; the seemingly authentic fragment of fact
is found to be faulty just when it seems flawlessly correct;
the colorful description of some ephemeral engine of the past
just cannot be reconciled with contemporary accounts and
finally proves to have been prepared long afterward, replete
with the inaccuracies which most unfortunately result from
the inroads made by time upon the recollections of the most
careful observer.</p>
<p>Through all this confusing maze the author step by step
has made his way, the result being a most noteworthy and
valuable contribution to the literature of the steam locomotive.
To students of its history, to the vast body of railway
enthusiasts all over the world, and to those generally interested
in the development of mechanical industry and transportation,
this work must appeal as unique and one that will
be long remembered.</p>

<p class="tb">Altogether, perhaps a quarter of a million steam locomotives
have been built in America. From the first
they have been objects of interest to young and old. They
have been depicted and photographed untold times, and as
a result a wonderfully accurate pictorial record of their construction
and appearance has been built up.</p>
<p>The locomotives themselves, however, as they wore out
or fell into disuse were usually destroyed for the value of their
scrap metal. This process has been greatly hastened in recent
years by the trend toward the use of diesel-electric and other
types of motive power. Few remain of the busy multitudes of
steam locomotives that served so well in building the Nations
on this continent. The picturesque and once popular steamer
has today become the vanishing iron horse.</p>
<p>It is proposed to deal here only with the relics and replicas
of the historic steam locomotives used during the pioneer
days of railroading on this continent, in the period 1825-1849.
Of these, only 11 have survived in even reasonably
complete form. With the remaining parts of several others,
they are accounted museum treasures. Full sized operable
replicas of 7 other famous early locomotives have been constructed.
All these together afford a good idea of the actual
construction of the locomotives of long ago.</p>
<p>Not to be included, are the many nonoperable, wooden
facsimiles of early locomotives that merely serve to show the
general external appearance of the originals they represent.
Many such are to be seen in the railroad collection in the
Baltimore and Ohio Transportation Museum located at the
old Mount Clare station and roundhouse at Baltimore, Md.</p>
<p>Also not to be included are the modern, full sized, operable
replicas of Robert Stephenson&rsquo;s famous locomotive
<i>Rocket</i> of 1829, of which several exist in the United States
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
(one is in the Henry Ford Museum at Dearborn, Mich.,
another is in the Museum of Science and Industry at
Chicago, Ill.). These replicas, built 100 years later by Robert
Stephenson &amp; Co., Ltd., of Darlington, England, do not represent
a locomotive actually used in North America during
the pioneering days of railroading here, and therefore do not
fall into the category covered by this work.</p>
<p>Various old models of suggested designs for locomotives
would not seem to come within the scope of this publication
either, as the full sized versions never came into being. One
such example is the model said to have been built by John
Fitch, and now exhibited in the Ohio State Archaeological
and Historical Society at Columbus, Ohio. As Fitch died in
July 1798, the model might, if authenticated as to builder
and purpose, be a very early example of an idea along the
lines of a steam locomotive.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is no assurance that the model
referred to was intended by its builder to represent a locomotive.
It is thought by most historians that the model is that
of a proposed power plant for a boat, for Fitch is known to
have constructed several successful steamboats a few years
before his death.</p>
<h3 id="c3">America&rsquo;s First Rail Locomotive</h3>
<p>Col. John Stevens of Hoboken, N. J., had by 1825 long
been intrigued with the idea of constructing a steam locomotive,
having had considerable success with steam as a method
of propulsion on water. In that year he constructed a small
experimental 4-wheeled engine, the first rail locomotive to
be built in this country. The unflanged wheels were kept on
the flat rails by vertical bars that projected down from each
corner of the locomotive. These were fitted on their lower
ends with horizontal rollers bearing on the inside of the rails.</p>
<p>Equipped with a vertical water-tube boiler, and with its
horizontal 1-cylinder power plant geared to a rack located
between the two rails, it was built only for demonstration
and experimentation. It was often run, however, on a small
circular track laid out on the lower lawn of Stevens&rsquo; estate
at Hoboken. This was the first steam railroad in America.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 1.&mdash;Original boiler, now in
National Museum, of experimental
locomotive built in 1825 by Col. John
Stevens.</p>
</div>
<p>Of this original locomotive only the boiler
and safety valve remain. They are on exhibition
at the National Museum (USNM
180029), where they were deposited in 1888
by the Stevens Institute of Technology. The
boiler (<a href="#fig1">figure 1</a>) contains 20 wrought-iron
tubes, each a little over 1 inch in outside diameter,
set closely together in a circle and
originally surrounding a circular grate, now
missing. It is 4 feet high, including the headers,
and 1 foot across, and was formerly enclosed
by a jacket of thin sheet iron topped by a conical
hood on which rested the smokestack.</p>
<p>Wood used as fuel was dropped onto the grate through a
door in the hood, and water was put into the boiler through
a pipe in the bottom header. Steam was taken from a 1-inch
pipe in the top header. The boiler when new is reported to
have sustained with safety a steam pressure of 550 pounds
per square inch. The design of the boiler was patented by
Stevens on April 11, 1803.</p>
<p>The safety valve (<a href="#fig2">figure 2</a>) is of simple design. It consists
of a lever 10 inches long from which a 4-pound lead ball
about 2&frac12; inches in diameter is suspended. Beneath the lever,
and about 1 inch in from the fulcrum, is a disk valve controlled
by the weight of the ball, which hangs by a stirrup
that can be moved to any of several notches, so that it can be
set for different pressures at which the valve will open.</p>

</div>
<p>A small, nonoperable model of the locomotive, about
2 feet long (<a href="#fig3">figure 3</a>), was made in the National Museum
in 1898 (USNM 180241) and is exhibited there. A full sized
operable replica, constructed in 1928 at the Altoona shops of
the Pennsylvania Railroad Co., was demonstrated (<a href="#fig4">figure 4</a>)
at the Stevens Institute of Technology on November
23, 1928, upon the occasion of the inauguration of Harvey
N. Davis as president of the Institute. It was given by the
Pennsylvania Railroad to the Museum of Science and Industry
at Chicago in 1932, where it is now exhibited.</p>
<p>Another replica of the Stevens locomotive, made by the
Pennsylvania in 1939, appeared in the railroad pageant at
the New York World&rsquo;s Fair in 1939 and 1940, and for a time
in 1941 was exhibited at the Pennsylvania Station in New
York City. In June 1941 it was placed on exhibition in the
museum of Stevens Institute, where it remained until March
1943. At that time it was returned to the Pennsylvania Railroad
Co., and has since been stored in their enginehouse at
Trenton, N. J.</p>

<p>The design of these replicas is based in part on the recollections
in the 1880&rsquo;s of the grandson of John Stevens, Dr.
Francis B. Stevens, who was a frequent passenger on the
original locomotive in 1825 at the age of 11. These recollections
are contained in letters from Dr. Stevens to J. Elfreth
Watkins, onetime curator of transportation and engineering
of the National Museum. Stevens&rsquo; letters, dated March 30,
1883, January 17, 1888, and November 19, 1892, are now
in the archives of the Museum.</p>

<h3 id="c4">Two British-Built Locomotives</h3>
<p>The next locomotives known to have been used in this
country were the British machines today popularly referred
to as the <i>America</i> (<a href="#fig5">figure 5</a>) and the <i>Stourbridge Lion</i> (<a href="#fig6">figure 6</a>).
They were contracted for in England in 1828 by Horatio
Allen, who had been sent there for that purpose by the
Delaware and Hudson Canal Co., and were delivered at
New York City in 1829.</p>
<p>The <i>America</i>, built by the already famous British firm of
Robert Stephenson &amp; Co., of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, arrived
from London on the ship <i>Columbia</i> on January 15. The
<i>Stourbridge Lion</i>, built by Foster, Rastrick and Co., of Stourbridge,
arrived from Liverpool on the <i>John Jay</i> on May 13.
The delivered price of the former was $3,663.30 and of the
latter $2,914.90. On July 2 they were shipped up the Hudson
River by the steamboat <i>Congress</i> to Rondout, N. Y.,
where they arrived on July 3.</p>

shown). The track shown is not the
type upon which the locomotive
ran at Honesdale, Pa.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Later in July the two locomotives were sent up the Delaware
and Hudson Canal from Eddyville, N. Y., to Honesdale,
Pa., where the <i>Stourbridge Lion</i> was subsequently tried
out on the newly laid railroad tracks of the Canal company.
The tests on August 8, and again on September 9, with
Horatio Allen at the controls, showed that although the performance
of the locomotive was satisfactory, the track was
not sufficiently stable to withstand the weight of the relatively
large machine. As a result of this failure, horses and
steam- or water-powered stationary engines (see <a href="#fig7">figure 7</a>)
constituted the motive power of this railroad until 1860.</p>
<p>The <i>Stourbridge Lion</i>, nevertheless, had earned the distinction
of being the first locomotive to operate in America on a
railroad built expressly for commercial traffic.</p>
<p>No record exists to show that the <i>America</i> was ever used,
and its subsequent history as a locomotive is unknown. Two
other locomotives were built by Foster, Rastrick and Co. for
the Delaware and Hudson Canal Co. As these were not delivered
to Rondout until after the <i>Lion</i> had demonstrated the
inadequacy of the track at Honesdale, they were not sent
there, but were instead stored at Rondout, where all trace of
them has been lost. It is thought they were destroyed by fire
while in storage.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 7.&mdash;Combining different methods of transportation
was common practice in the early days
of railroading. The Delaware and Hudson as late
as 1866, for example, carried coal by rail from
the mines of Scranton and Carbondale, Pa., to its
canal at Honesdale, Pa., and thence on barges
by way of Port Jervis, Ellenville, and Rondout,
N. Y., to New York City. On some early railroads,
horses drew the cars on level stretches, but in
hilly country where grades were very steep, gravity
roads with switchbacks and inclined planes
were often used. The inclined plane consisted of
a set of rails over which units of the train could
be raised or lowered by mechanical means.
Horses, water power, or a stationary steam engine,
often located at the top of the slope, were
among the sources of power.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>In 1890, Lindsay and Early of
Carbondale, Pa., deposited one of
the two cylinders (<a href="#fig8">figure 8</a>) of the
<i>America</i> in the National Museum
(USNM 180922). It has a 9-inch
bore and a 24-inch stroke, and
the piston (<a href="#fig9">figure 9</a>) is fitted with
two compression rings. (The location
of the other cylinder is today
unknown.)</p>
<p>Earlier, in 1888, the Delaware
and Hudson Canal Co. had given
to the Museum several locomotive
parts, all thought to have been
from the <i>Stourbridge Lion</i>. It has
been established, however,
through correspondence with E.
A. Forward, formerly of the
Science Museum, South Kensington,
London, and with the firm of
Robert Stephenson &amp; Hawthorns,
Ltd., that the three crank rings
(USNM 180030-<span class="small">C</span>) received at
that time are actually relics of the <i>America</i>.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 14.&mdash;Replica of <i>Stourbridge Lion</i> at New York World&rsquo;s Fair, May 20,
1939.</p>
</div>
<p>A full sized operable replica (<a href="#fig13">figure 13</a>) was constructed in
1932 by the Delaware and Hudson Railroad Corp. and lent
by them to the Wayne County Historical Society at Honesdale,
Pa. The cylinder bore of the replica is &#8311;/&#8321;&#8326; inches, the
stroke 36 inches. Since the outside dimensions of the original
cylinder are approximately those of the replica, its working
dimensions are probably also the same.</p>
<p>From time to time the replica has appeared in various
railroad pageants, including those at the Chicago World&rsquo;s
Fair in 1933 and 1934, the New York World&rsquo;s Fair in 1939
(<a href="#fig14">figure 14</a>) and 1940, and the Chicago Railroad Fair in
1948. Otherwise, it can be seen on exhibition at Honesdale,
the scene of the trials of the original <i>Stourbridge Lion</i>.</p>

<p>No original parts remain of one of the best known early
locomotives, the <i>Tom Thumb</i>. A full sized operable replica
(<a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>), however, was made in 1926 by the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad Co. for use in their exhibit that year at the
Philadelphia Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition. It
has since appeared at the Fair of the Iron Horse, held at
Halethorpe, near Baltimore, in the fall of 1927, the Chicago
World&rsquo;s Fair in 1933 and 1934, the New York World&rsquo;s Fair
in 1939 and 1940, and the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948
and 1949. Its permanent home is in Baltimore, at the Baltimore
and Ohio Transportation Museum.</p>
<p>A small nonoperable model of the <i>Tom Thumb</i>, about 2 feet
long (<a href="#fig16">figure 16</a>), made in the National Museum in 1890
(USNM 204581), is exhibited in the collection of the Museum.
Other small models of it appear in the B &amp; O
Museum. One of these, a &frac14;-inch-scale model recently made
under the direction of Lawrence W. Sagle of the B &amp; O
Museum, differs somewhat from the usually accepted idea of
the <i>Tom Thumb</i>.</p>
<p>Notably, the smokestack is not straight, but has an elbow
at its upper end, and the belt-driven blower is located there
rather than on the floor of the machine as in the replica and
the other models. Peter Cooper, the New York engineer and
inventor who constructed the original <i>Tom Thumb</i> as an experiment
in the winter of 1829-1830, mentioned this upper
location of the blower in a speech delivered many years later,
in 1875, and quoted in Bulletin 73 of the Railway and
Locomotive Historical Society (1948, pp. 50-52).</p>
<p>The little locomotive, with its vertical boiler made of rifle
barrels, looked rather like the larger locomotive of John
Stevens of only several years earlier but had considerably
smaller wheels, these being only 30 inches in diameter.</p>
<p>Although a 3&frac14;-inch bore for its vertical 1-cylinder engine
is given by most writers, Jonathan Knight, chief engineer of
the Baltimore and Ohio, in the fourth annual report of the
company (for 1830, p. 35) gives the figure as 3&frac12;. Unfortunately,
he does not mention the stroke, which is usually
given elsewhere as either 14&frac14; or 14&frac12; inches. The bore and
stroke of the replica were made 5 and 27 inches so as to give
it sufficient power to operate satisfactorily. For that matter,
in the interest of sturdiness and suitable operation the replica
is somewhat larger in all respects and considerably heavier
than the original. It operates on a steam pressure of 90
pounds per square inch, and it is reported that the original
did likewise.</p>

<p>The <i>Tom Thumb</i> was engaged in its famous race with the
horse-drawn railroad car in the summer of 1830 on a parallel
section of the new 13-mile stretch of track between Baltimore
and Ellicott&rsquo;s Mills. It covered the 13 miles between the
Mount Clare station and Ellicott&rsquo;s Mills in a little over an
hour, and the return trip in 57 minutes. The race with
the horse-drawn car took place during the return trip. The
<i>Tom Thumb</i> appeared to be a certain winner until temporary
slipping of the belt driving the blower caused the steam pressure
to drop and allowed the horse to become the victor.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the <i>Tom Thumb</i> by this and later trips in the
same year proved that steam locomotives were practicable,
and caused the railroad officials to announce on January 4,
1831, a proposed contest (to be somewhat similar to the
famous Rainhill Trials held in October 1829 in England) in
which the best locomotive demonstrated would be purchased
by the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Co. for the sum of
$4,000.</p>
<p>The winner of this contest, the <i>York</i>, a vertical-boiler
locomotive built in early 1831 by Phineas Davis, a former
watchmaker of York, Pa., is in the same category as the <i>Tom
Thumb</i>, not only in that no original parts survive, but also in
that a full sized operable replica of it (<a href="#fig17">figure 17</a>) has been
constructed. This was built by the Baltimore and Ohio in
1927 for use in the Fair of the Iron Horse. It also appeared at
the Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair in 1933 and 1934, after which it
was presented to the Museum of Science and Industry at
Chicago, where it has since remained.</p>
<p>The original <i>York</i> was used successfully on the run between
Baltimore and Ellicott&rsquo;s Mills, and subsequently on the
much longer run of some 40 miles between Baltimore and
the inclined planes at Parr&rsquo;s Ridge, on the way to Frederick
Town and Point of Rocks, Md. (Horse power was used to
raise the cars at Parr&rsquo;s Ridge in 1832.)</p>

</div>
<p>As the first practical and generally serviceable locomotive
of the early Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the <i>York</i> influenced
considerably the design of the company&rsquo;s subsequent
locomotives. Within a year Davis had constructed several
locomotives of a generally similar design, all with vertical
boilers (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>).</p>
<p>The <i>York</i> had wheels 30 inches in diameter, weighed about
3&frac12; tons, and had a top speed of 30 miles an hour. Not long
after its construction, it was drastically altered in design and
appearance. The vertical cylinders were removed from the
opposite sides of the boiler, where they had operated the four
wheels by means of direct-acting rods and trussed side bars,
and inclined adjacent cylinders were located behind the
boiler, where they operated by means of gearing on the rear
axle only.</p>
<p>The modern replica, however, represents the <i>York</i> as it was
originally designed and constructed. It operates on a steam
pressure of 115 pounds per square inch. The original is said
to have operated on 100 pounds per square inch, and it
burned anthracite coal, a very early use of that fuel in locomotives.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 18.&mdash;Early drawing of <i>Best Friend of Charleston</i>, built in 1830.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The scene is now shifted to South Carolina and New York.
The West Point Foundry Association, situated in New York
City, had been the location of a stationary demonstration
under steam of the blocked-up <i>Stourbridge Lion</i> on May 28,
1829, shortly after it was unloaded from the ship that brought
it from Liverpool. The Association soon thereafter built a
locomotive (<a href="#fig18">figure 18</a>) for the South-Carolina Canal and
Rail-Road Co., which was building a line from Charleston
to Hamburg, S. C., just across the Savannah River from
Augusta, Ga. Prior to its adoption of the steam locomotive,
the railroad had used horses to draw its cars, and had even
experimented with a wind-propelled sail car.</p>
<p>The locomotive, the <i>Best Friend of Charleston</i>, which was to
become the first to operate on a regularly scheduled run in
this country, was constructed at a cost of $4,000 in the summer
of 1830, and arrived at Charleston on October 23 of
that year, on the ship <i>Niagara</i>. The same Horatio Allen who
had tested the <i>Stourbridge Lion</i> for the Delaware and Hudson
had become chief engineer of the South-Carolina Canal and
Rail-Road Co. and was one of those responsible for the plans
of the <i>Best Friend</i>.</p>
<p>Local machinists at Charleston were hired to reassemble
the locomotive and prepare it for its first trial, but when the
run was made on November 2, 1830, the wheels were discovered
to be unsatisfactory. They were replaced by sturdier
ones, and following a subsequent test on December 9, the
locomotive was accepted. After several more experimental
runs, some with passengers, the official first run, carrying
141 persons, finally took place on Christmas Day 1830.</p>
<p>Notice of the coming event had been published the previous
day, so it became the first steam railroad train run
scheduled by &ldquo;timetable&rdquo; to be made in the Western
Hemisphere. All previous locomotive operations on this side
of the Atlantic had been purely experimental&mdash;for test or
demonstration purposes. At the time of this run the tracks of
the railroad extended only about 6 miles out of Charleston,
but by October 3, 1833, the full 136 miles to Hamburg had
been completed. The South-Carolina Canal and Rail-Road
was then the longest continuous railroad in the world (see
<a href="#fig19">figure 19</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>A description of the <i>Best Friend</i> by David Matthew, who in
1830 had been foreman of the West Point Foundry Association,
is contained in a letter he wrote in 1859 to the historian
William H. Brown. Later quoted by Brown in his &ldquo;History
of the First Locomotives in America,&rdquo; the letter says in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>Best Friend</i> was a four-wheel engine, all four wheels drivers.
Two inclined cylinders at an angle, working down on a double
crank, inside of the frame, with the wheels outside of the frame,
each wheel connecting together outside, with outside rods. The
wheels were iron hub, wooden spokes and felloes, with iron tire,
and iron web and pins in the wheels to connect the outside rods to.</p>
<p>The boiler was a vertical one, in form of an old-fashioned
porter-bottle, the furnace at the bottom surrounded with water,
and all filled inside full of what we called teats, running out from
the sides and top, with alternate stays to support the crown of the
furnace; the smoke and gas passing out through the sides at
several points, into an outside jacket; which had the chimney on
it. The boiler sat on a frame upon four wheels, with the connecting-rods
running by it to come into the crankshaft. The cylinders
were about six inches in the bore, and sixteen inches&rsquo; stroke.
Wheels about four and a half feet in diameter. The whole machine
weighed about four and a half tons.</p>

claimed to be &ldquo;wheel of first locomotive
used on first railroad of any
length in America,&mdash;Charleston,
S. C., to Augusta, Ga., 1835.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Best Friend</i>, as such, was short-lived. It gave service
that was entirely satisfactory up to the moment its boiler
exploded on June 17, 1831, when one of the helpers on the
locomotive deliberately held the safety valve closed.</p>
<p>According to the statement in 1869 of Nicholas W.
Darrell, first engineer of the <i>Best Friend</i> and later superintendent
of machinery of the South-Carolina Canal and
Rail-Road, the salvageable parts were used in constructing
another locomotive which was appropriately named the
<i>Phoenix</i>. Darrell&rsquo;s recollection is confirmed by the early
reports of the company, which also reveal that the machinery
and new boiler were arranged differently on the <i>Phoenix</i>,
the cylinders being placed outside the frame, and the weight
being much more evenly distributed. The <i>Phoenix</i> was put in
service on October 18, 1832.</p>
<p>Although no documented relics of either of these two locomotives
remain, the Redwood Library at Newport, R. I.,
now exhibits an all-metal wheel (<a href="#fig20">figure 20</a>) claimed to be
from the &ldquo;first locomotive used on first railroad of any length
in America. Charleston, S. C., to Augusta, Ga., 1835.&rdquo; Quite
probably it is a replacement wheel from the <i>Phoenix</i>, for Darrell
also stated in 1869 that cast wheels with wrought tires
were used to replace the original wooden wheels with iron
tires that were on the <i>Best Friend</i> when it was salvaged to
construct the <i>Phoenix</i>.</p>

<p>The wheel at Newport is built up of parts, and consists of
a large round hub, 12 round 1&frac14;-inch-diameter spokes, a rim
approximately 46 inches in diameter and 4&frac12; inches wide,
and a flanged tire 4&frac34; inches wide and about 1 inch thick,
the flange of which is 2 inches wide on its outside face. The
wheel, therefore, has a diameter of about 48 inches. The
spokes are staggered in the hub and appear to be fastened to
it by threaded nuts. Four keyways are cut into the hole in
the hub. The complete history and exact origin of this wheel,
given to the Redwood Library in January 1863 by Isaac P.
Hazard of Newport, will probably remain a mystery.</p>
<p>As with other early locomotives, a full sized operable
replica of the <i>Best Friend</i> has been built. The Southern Railway
System, which now includes the old South-Carolina
Canal and Rail-Road, in 1928 constructed a faithful replica
of the locomotive at its Birmingham, Ala., shops, and in the
same year reproduced the original tender and several cars
at its shops at Hayne, S. C. (<a href="#fig21">figure 21</a>). A new boiler was
installed on the replica in 1948.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Among the various fairs at which it has
been exhibited are those held at New York in
1939 and 1940 and in Chicago in 1948 and
1949. At present it is to be seen in the depot of
the Chattanooga Station Co. at Chattanooga,
Tenn.</p>
<p>A small, nonoperable model of the <i>Best
Friend</i>, about 2 feet long (<a href="#fig22">figure 22</a>), with
tender and two cars, was made in the late
1880&rsquo;s by D. Ballauf, well known model maker
of Washington, D. C. It was first exhibited at
the Cincinnati Centennial Exposition in 1888,
after which it was placed on exhibition in the
National Museum (USNM 180244).</p>
<p>Of the <i>West Point</i>, the second locomotive
built by the West Point Foundry Association,
and the second bought by the South-Carolina
Canal and Rail-Road Co., no relics or replicas
are known to exist. A satisfactory locomotive,
it arrived at Charleston on the ship
<i>Lafayette</i> on February 28, 1831. Its final disposition
is no longer known.</p>

<p>The third locomotive (<a href="#fig23">figure 23</a>) built by the West Point
Foundry Association, the <i>De Wilt Clinton</i> of the Mohawk and
Hudson Rail Road Co., was the first to run in New York
State. Its first public demonstration was an excursion trip on
August 9, 1831, on a 12-mile stretch of railway between
Albany and Schenectady. The distance was covered in less
than one hour. Another notable demonstration, attended by
many public officials, took place on September 24 of the
same year.</p>
<p>The locomotive, which had been shipped up the Hudson
River to Albany during the last week of June with David
Matthew in charge, weighed a little over 6,750 pounds, was
11&frac12; feet long, and was mounted on four 54-inch wheels, all
of which were drivers. The two cylinders, at the rear of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
locomotive and connected to the axle of the front wheels,
had a bore of 5&frac12; inches and a stroke of 16 inches. The boiler
was tubular, with copper tubes about 2&frac12; inches in diameter
and 6 feet long. The top speed when pulling a load of about
8 tons was said to have been about 30 miles an hour.</p>

</div>
<p>The <i>De Witt Clinton</i> was never completely satisfactory, and
after infrequent use in 1831 and 1832 it was disassembled
and disposed of piece by piece. Some of the parts were listed
as sold on April 20, 1835, others on September 13 and October
29, 1836. A total of $485 was realized from the various
sales.</p>
<p>In 1891, a wheel said to have been one of the wheels of the
original <i>De Witt Clinton</i>, was deposited in the National
Museum (USNM 180947) by William Buchanan, at that
time superintendent of motive power of the New York Central
and Hudson River Railroad Co. The all-metal wheel
(figure 24) contains 14 round, 1-inch-diameter spokes staggered
around the hub, and is 52&frac12; inches in diameter. The
flanged metal tire is missing from the rim, which is 4&#8539; inches
wide, but its presence would undoubtedly bring the overall
diameter of the wheel up to 54 inches.</p>

operable replica of the <i>De Witt Clinton</i> locomotive, tender,
and cars, first shown at the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition

from the original plans of 1831, was made at the railroad&rsquo;s
shops at West Albany, N. Y. During the past 60 years the
replica has undergone a number of repair operations, but it
remains authentic. It has been exhibited on many occasions
(figure 26).</p>
<p>Since the 1893 unveiling of the replica of the train at
Chicago, it has been displayed at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition at St. Louis in 1904, the Fair of the Iron Horse

New York World&rsquo;s Fair in 1939 and 1940, the Chicago Railroad
Fair in 1948 and 1949, and on many other occasions.
For years the train was exhibited on a balcony within New

been on loan from the New York Central System to the

</div>
<p>Probably the most famous and historic old locomotive in
the United States today is the <i>John Bull</i>, the oldest complete
and operable locomotive in the country (<a href="#fig29">figure 29</a>). Built in
England in 1831 by Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. of Newcastle-upon-Tyne,
it was officially placed in service on November
12, 1831, at Bordentown, N. J., on the lines of the Camden
and Amboy Rail Road and Transportation Co., now a part
of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. In regular service until
1865, the locomotive was given by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Co. to the National Museum in 1885 (USNM 180001).
It should not be confused with another Stephenson-built
locomotive of the same name, built for the Mohawk and
Hudson Rail Road Co. at the same time but no longer in
existence.</p>
<p>The Camden and Amboy&rsquo;s <i>John Bull</i>, its first locomotive,
was ordered from Stephenson by Robert L. Stevens of New
Jersey, son of the railroad pioneer Col. John Stevens, and
president of the company, who had gone to England in
October 1830 for this purpose, as well as to purchase iron
rails of his design for the track of the new railroad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>The locomotive was completed early in the summer of
1831 and was shipped from Liverpool on the ship <i>Allegheny</i>,
which sailed for Philadelphia on July 14. It had been disassembled
for shipping, as were most of the early locomotives,
and it is interesting to note that the freight charge was only
&pound;19, or a little under $100. The total cost of the locomotive,
incidentally, was &pound;784 7s. 0d., or a little under $4,000.</p>
<p>The engine arrived at Philadelphia about the middle of
August, and was then transshipped by sloop to Bordentown,
near Trenton, whence a few miles of rail were soon to head
northeastward toward South Amboy. The mechanics who
assembled the locomotive found it a mysterious and completely
unfamiliar device. After considerable experimentation
the task was successfully accomplished under the leadership
of Isaac Dripps, a local youth who later rose to a position
of importance in the Pennsylvania Railroad.</p>
<p>In its first test the locomotive was fired up to 30 pounds
steam pressure, and Dripps, with Stevens by his side, opened
the throttle of the first locomotive of what was to become
part of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. The engine was disassembled
for a few minor modifications shortly after this
trial, and a few weeks later, on November 12, the official first
trip was made.</p>
<p>The <i>John Bull</i> as it appeared when first placed in service in
1831 was described in detail by J. Elfreth Watkins in his
&ldquo;Camden and Amboy Railroad,&rdquo; published in 1891. He
wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The engine originally weighed about ten tons. The boiler was
thirteen feet long and three feet six inches in diameter. The cylinders
were nine inches by twenty inches. There were four driving
wheels four feet six inches in diameter, arranged with outside
cranks for connecting parallel rods, but owing to the sharp curves
on the road these rods were never used. The driving wheels were
made with cast-iron hubs and wooden (locust) spokes and felloes.
The tires were of wrought iron, three-quarters of an inch thick,
the tread being five inches and the depth of flange one and a-half
inches. The gauge was originally five feet from center to center of
rails. The boiler was composed of sixty-two flues seven feet six
inches long, two inches in diameter; the furnace was three feet
seven inches long and three feet two inches high, for burning
wood. The steam ports were one and one-eighth inches by six and
a-half inches; the exhaust ports one and one-eighth by six and
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
a-half inches; grate surface, ten feet eight inches; fire-box surface,
thirty-six feet; flue surface, two hundred and thirteen feet; weight,
without fuel or water, twenty-two thousand four hundred and
twenty-five pounds.</p>
<p>After the valves were in gear and the engine in motion, two
levers on the engineman&rsquo;s side moved back and forth continuously.
When it was necessary to put the locomotive on the turn-table,
enginemen who were skilled in the handling of the engines
first put the valves out of gear by turning the handle down, and
then worked the levers by hand, thus moving the valves to the
proper position and stopping the engine at the exact point desired.</p>
<p>The reversing gear was a very complicated affair. The two eccentrics
were secured to a sleeve or barrel, which fitted loosely on
the crank-shaft, between the two cranks, so as to turn freely. A
treadle was used to change the position of this loose eccentric
sleeve on the shaft of the driving wheel (moving it to the right or
left) when it was necessary to reverse. Two carriers were secured
firmly to the body of this shaft (one on each side of the eccentrics);
one carrier worked the engine ahead, the other back. The small
handle on the right side of the boiler was used to lift the eccentric-rod
(which passed forward to the rock shaft on the forward part of
the engine) off the pin, and thus put the valves out of gear before
it was possible to shift the sleeve and reverse the engine.</p>
<p>As no tender came with the locomotive, one was improvised
from a four-wheel flat car that had been used on construction
work, which was soon equipped to carry water and wood. The
water tank consisted of a large whiskey cask which was procured
from a Bordentown storekeeper, and this was securely fastened
on the center of this four-wheeled car. A hole was bored up
through the car into the barrel and into it a piece of two-inch tin
pipe was fastened, projecting below the platform of the car. It now
became necessary to devise some plan to get the water from the
tank to the pump and into the boiler around the turns under the
cars, and as a series of rigid sections of pipe was not practicable,
young Dripps procured four sections of hose two feet long, which
he had made out of shoe leather by a Bordentown shoemaker.
These were attached to the pipes and securely fastened by bands
of waxed thread. The hogshead was filled with water, a supply of
wood for fuel was obtained, and the engine and tender were ready
for work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The distance between the two main axles on the locomotive
is just 5 feet, and the gauge is 56&frac12; inches. The overall
length of the locomotive, including the pilot, is 25 feet; of the
tender, 12 feet.</p>
<p>Watkins has given the cylinder bore as 9 inches, a figure
also used by C. F. Dendy Marshall in his &ldquo;Two Essays in
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
Early Locomotive History,&rdquo; and by J. G. H. Warren in his
&ldquo;A Century of Locomotive Building,&rdquo; both excellent publications.
In fact, however, the cylinder bore of the <i>John Bull</i>
was recently measured and found to be 11 inches. The stroke
of 20 inches as cited by all is correct.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 30.&mdash;Another pre-1900 view of <i>John Bull</i>, which was built in England by
Stephenson in 1831.</p>
</div>
<p>Many changes, some minor and some major, were incorporated
in the <i>John Bull</i> during the next few years. The most
noticeable was the addition of a 2-wheeled pilot, suggested in
1832 by Robert L. Stevens to guide the locomotive around
the sharp curves common in the tracks of that era. In order
to attach the pilot to the front axle, the outside rods and
cranks connecting the front and back axles had to be permanently
removed, thus reducing the number of drivers from
four to two. The <i>John Bull</i> has ever since been driven by only
the two rear wheels (<a href="#fig30">figure 30</a>). The wheels of the pilot are
29 inches in diameter.</p>
<p>Another early permanent change was the replacement of
the wooden-spoked wheels with those of cast iron. The old
wooden carriage-type wheels could not stand up under service
in America, where sharp curves in the tracks prevailed.
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
A wheel, said to be one of the originals (<a href="#fig31">figure 31</a>) but lacking
the flanged metal tire, was presented to the National
Museum (USNM 181194) by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Co. in 1894. An inch or so less in diameter than 54 inches,
the wheel would certainly be of the original size if the tire
were in place. The 14 spokes and the felloe are of wood.
Metal bands, similar to the crank rings of the <i>America</i> (now
affixed to the reconstructed wheels of the restored <i>Stourbridge
Lion</i>, see <a href="#Page_20">p. 20</a>), are included in the construction of this old
wheel of the <i>John Bull</i>.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 31.&mdash;Original wooden-spoked

</div>
<p>Whether or not it is one of the original wheels applied to
the locomotive by Stephenson can not at this time be definitely
proved. Possibly it is an early wooden-spoked wheel
built and tried by the Camden and Amboy prior to the
adoption of the all-metal wheels now on the locomotive. Another
similar wheel, until recently located in the Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
library in its Suburban Station Building in Philadelphia,
is now in storage. These two wheels were included in
that railroad&rsquo;s exhibit at the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition
in 1893.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>Among the many other changes to the <i>John Bull</i> were the
addition of a bell, a whistle, and a headlight, as well as a
dial-type steam pressure gauge (<a href="#fig32">figure 32</a>), and the relocation
of the axle springs, the water cocks, the safety valve, and
the steam dome. At one time a cab was installed at the rear
of the locomotive, and an 8-wheeled tender was in use
(<a href="#fig33">figure 33</a>).</p>
<p>The tender as seen today is basically original, but much of
the woodwork was in such poor repair that it was completely
disassembled in 1910 and stored, the rotted pieces of wood
being discarded. In 1930 the tender was completely restored
at the Altoona shops of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co., and
since that time has been exhibited constantly with the
locomotive.</p>

</div>
<p>Prior to its presentation to the National Museum, the <i>John
Bull</i> had appeared at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia
in 1876, and at the Exposition of Railway Appliances
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
at Chicago in 1883. In early 1893, the locomotive and tender
were taken from Washington to New York City, and on
April 17 proceeded under steam, pulling two old cars of the
period of 1836 (<a href="#fig34">figure 34</a>), to the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition
at Chicago. It arrived without mishap on April 22 after
having covered 912 miles. The locomotive and tender were
returned to the Museum in December 1893 after having
made daily demonstration runs at the exposition. They returned
to Washington under steam via Pittsburgh, Altoona,
Harrisburg, and Baltimore. The next time the locomotive
left the Museum&rsquo;s confines was for a brief sojourn at the Fair
of the Iron Horse in 1927 (<a href="#fig35">figure 35</a>). More recently it appeared
at the Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair in 1933 and the New
York World&rsquo;s Fair in 1939 and 1940.</p>
<p>In early 1940, a full sized operable replica of the <i>John Bull</i>
locomotive (<a href="#fig36">figure 36</a>) was made at the Altoona shops of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Co. The cylinder dimensions of 11
by 20 inches were apparently known by the shops at that
time, as the drawings made then for use in building the
replica show the bore and stroke to be 10&#8542; by 20 inches. Perhaps
the bore of the original locomotive was also 10&#8542; inches
in 1831, and was increased to 11 inches through many years
of wear. However, the figure of 9 inches for the bore, so often
used in the past, is definitely incorrect.</p>

<p>Earlier, in 1927, a full sized replica of the tender had been
constructed at Altoona. This replica of the tender appeared
with the original locomotive at the Fair of the Iron Horse in
1927, but since 1930 the restored original tender has always
appeared with the original locomotive. In 1940, the replica
of the locomotive, accompanied by the replica of the tender,
appeared at the New York World&rsquo;s Fair as a moving exhibit,
while the original locomotive and tender appeared there as
a stationary exhibit. The replica again appeared at the Chicago
Railroad Fair in both 1948 and 1949. When not on
exhibition, the replica is usually stored at the Pennsylvania&rsquo;s
enginehouse at Northumberland, Pa.</p>
<p>A small, nonoperable model of the <i>John Bull</i> and its tender
(<a href="#fig37">figure 37</a>), with two of the cars of the 1831 period, together
about 6&frac12; feet long, was made in the National Museum by
C. R. Luscombe about 1900, and is included in the
Museum&rsquo;s collection (USNM 233510). The units are represented
as the originals appeared in 1831, without the pilot
on the locomotive, and without the sides and top on the
tender.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<h3 id="c8">Three Grasshoppers</h3>
<p>As a result of the success of Phineas Davis&rsquo; <i>York</i> on the
Baltimore and Ohio (see <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>), about 18 more small locomotives
with vertical boilers were built for the B &amp; O between
1832 and 1837, the first few by Davis<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> and his partner
Israel Gartner,<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> several by Charles Reeder, and the remainder
by George Gillingham and Ross Winans. These machines,
with their vertical cylinders and their walking beams,
earned the name &ldquo;grasshopper&rdquo; because of their peculiar
appearance when under way.</p>
<p>Of the many &ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo; constructed, three have survived.
The earliest, the <i>John Quincy Adams</i>, was built in July
1835 and is now exhibited in Carillon Park at Dayton, Ohio,
where it has been for several years, the gift of the Baltimore
and Ohio. The remaining two, the <i>Andrew Jackson</i> and the
<i>John Hancock</i>, were built in 1836 and are now housed in the
B &amp; O Museum at Baltimore.</p>
<p>The history of these three locomotives is somewhat complicated.
All were in use at the Mount Clare station in Baltimore
as recently as 1892, then serving as switching engines.
At that time, with a fourth, the <i>Martin Van Buren</i> of 1836,
they were retired from active service so they could be
modified for the exhibit the B &amp; O was planning for the following
year at the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition.</p>
<p>As it was the desire of the B &amp; O to show in this exhibit
some earlier &ldquo;grasshoppers,&rdquo; the <i>Andrew Jackson</i> (<a href="#fig38">figure 38</a>)
was altered to resemble the first &ldquo;grasshopper&rdquo; built, Davis&rsquo;
<i>Atlantic</i> of 1832 (<a href="#fig39">figure 39</a>); while the <i>John Quincy Adams</i> was
rebuilt to resemble the <i>Traveller</i> (originally named the <i>Indian
Chief</i>) of 1833.</p>
<p>The <i>John Hancock</i>, unaltered, was merely renamed the
<i>Thomas Jefferson</i> (<a href="#fig40">figure 40</a>), a &ldquo;grasshopper&rdquo; of 1835. Why
the <i>John Quincy Adams</i>, itself built in 1835, was not used for
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
this purpose under its original name, is not now understood.
(The <i>Martin Van Buren</i>, now no longer in existence, was
altered considerably at that time to resemble the <i>Mazeppa</i>, a
so-called &ldquo;crab&rdquo; engine of 1838.)</p>

</div>
<p>The original <i>Andrew Jackson</i>, ever since called the <i>Atlantic</i>
(<a href="#fig41">figure 41</a>), has appeared at many railroad pageants
throughout the East (<a href="#fig42">figure 42</a>); in 1935 and 1936 it was on
exhibit in the National Museum (<a href="#fig43">figure 43</a>). The <i>John Hancock</i>,
on the other hand, was recently given back its original
name (<a href="#fig44">figure 44</a>) after having carried the incorrect appellation
<i>Thomas Jefferson</i> for about 60 years. Many railroad historians
of recent times have apparently not been aware of
the name-switching involving these two locomotives, which
are now part of the permanent collection in the B &amp; O
Museum.</p>

<p>The <i>John Quincy Adams</i> (<a href="#fig45">figure 45</a>), recently restored and
repainted and no longer referred to as the <i>Traveller</i>, is the
oldest complete American-built locomotive in existence.</p>
<p>These &ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo; burned anthracite, as did the <i>York</i>.
The cylinders of the newer two of the survivors have a 22-inch
stroke and a 12&frac12;-inch bore (according to the 10th annual
report of the B &amp; O, for 1836, p. 22) and originally
operated on a steam pressure of 50 pounds per square inch.
With their thoroughly overhauled boilers, they now operate
on 75. The bore of the <i>John Quincy Adams</i> is slightly smaller,
12&frac14; inches (according to the 9th annual report of the B &amp;
O, for 1835, p. 24), unless it has been increased by wear or
replacement.</p>
<p>The wheelbase of each &ldquo;grasshopper&rdquo; is 49 inches, and the
weight was originally about 8&frac12; tons. The wheels, modern
replacements, are about 34 inches in diameter but the original
ones were several inches larger. All four wheels of each
are (or were) connected by gearing and rods to the two
cylinders. In converting the <i>Andrew Jackson</i> to represent the
<i>Atlantic</i>, however, the side rods were removed so that only its
rear wheels now serve as drivers, as did those of the original
<i>Atlantic</i>.</p>
<p>It is of interest that at least one other &ldquo;grasshopper&rdquo; locomotive
was built by Gillingham and Winans, but not for the
B &amp; O. Named the <i>Columbus</i>, this generally little known example
was made in 1836 for the Leipzig to Dresden Railroad
in Germany, and quite probably was the first American
locomotive ever built for export. A description and illustration
of it are found in the German publication &ldquo;Hundert
Jahre deutsche Eisenbahnen,&rdquo; published in 1935.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h3 id="c9">Two Midwestern Locomotives</h3>
<p>Among the early locomotives that have survived is the
<i>Pioneer</i> (<a href="#fig46">figure 46</a>), the first to have steamed out of Chicago,
this having occurred on October 25, 1848, at the opening of
the Galena and Chicago Union Rail Road. Built early in
1836, the <i>Pioneer</i> was the 37th constructed by Matthias W.
Baldwin and is the oldest Baldwin locomotive now in
existence.</p>
<p>It was originally sold to the Utica and Schenectady Rail
Road, in New York&rsquo;s Mohawk Valley, and was their locomotive
<i>No. 7</i>. Later it was sold to the Michigan Central Railroad,
by whom it was reportedly renamed the <i>Alert</i>, a name
that is open to question. From the latter road the Galena
and Chicago Union obtained it in 1848.</p>
<p>In order to get the locomotive to Chicago, it had to be
shipped by boat across Lake Michigan from Michigan City,
Ind., and hauled by teams to the tracks. The little Baldwin
locomotive at this time was given the name <i>Pioneer</i>. Its new
owner, the Galena and Chicago Union, later, in 1864, was
merged into the then 5-year-old Chicago and North Western
Railway Co.</p>

</div>
<p>The <i>Pioneer</i> had a full and active life, for it was in operation
12 years prior to its acquisition by the Galena road
and 26 years after (<a href="#fig47">figure 47</a>). It was at one time temporarily
lent to the new Chicago, Burlington and Quincy line, until
that company was able to buy an engine of its own, and was
finally retired by the Chicago and North Western in 1874.</p>
<p>The <i>Pioneer</i> is a typical Baldwin design of the period. A
wood burner, it weighs 10 tons, has slightly inclined cylinders
11 by 18 inches in size, one pair of 54-inch driving
wheels at the rear, and a 4-wheeled swiveling truck at the
front. The cylinder bore was originally 10 inches, but in
1872 the Chicago and North Western changed it to the present
slightly larger dimension.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>While owned by the Michigan Central, it
had been altered in several ways, the principal
change being in the valve motion. The
locomotive originally had a single fixed eccentric
for each cylinder, with two arms extending
backward. These arms were fitted with drop
hooks to engage with a pin on a rocker arm
that actuated the valve rod. The new motion,
installed by the Michigan Central, uses double
eccentrics with <span class="ss">V</span>-hooks for each cylinder. The
cab and the cowcatcher, not applied to the
locomotive when it was constructed in 1836,
are of a slightly later period according to an
article in &ldquo;Baldwin Locomotives&rdquo; (vol. 10, No.
2, October 1931, pp. 3, 4).</p>
<p>In common with many of the other surviving
old locomotives, the <i>Pioneer</i> has been on
exhibition at many places, including the Exposition
of Railway Appliances at Chicago in
1883, the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition held
there 10 years later, the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition at St. Louis in 1904, the Chicago
World&rsquo;s Fair 30 years later, and the Chicago
Railroad Fair in 1948 and 1949. At the latter
fair it operated under its own power every day
each summer, requiring only the replacement
of the old boiler flues with new ones of sturdier
construction to make it again serviceable. In recent years it
has been exhibited at the Museum of Science and Industry
at Chicago, but is now stored in that city in one of the shops
of the Chicago and North Western.</p>
<p>Not a great deal is known of the early history of the
<i>Mississippi</i> (<a href="#fig48">figure 48</a>), which is now exhibited at the Museum
of Science and Industry at Chicago. Originally it was
used on a pioneering railroad operating east out of Natchez
in the late 1830&rsquo;s. Some writers have contended that it was
imported from England. Others, including Angus Sinclair,
the railroad historian, have stated that it was probably built
by the New York firm of H. R. Dunham and Co.</p>

period. Photo may have been taken after locomotive was rebuilt for exhibition at
World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition at Chicago, in 1893.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Mississippi</i>, however, has none of the characteristics
of English locomotives of its period, and it is well known that
a representative of Dunham took several locomotives from
New York to Natchez in late 1836. It is most probable that
the <i>Mississippi</i> is a Dunham-built locomotive of the middle
1830&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Its first recorded service began in April 1837, between
Natchez and Hamburg, Miss., a distance of about 19 miles.
A violent storm lashed Natchez on May 7, 1840, and
destroyed considerable railroad property. From this and subsequent
financial blows the little railroad shortly succumbed,
and the <i>Mississippi</i> passed to other owners. Among these
were the Grand Gulf and Port Gibson Railroad, the Mississippi
Valley and Ship Island Railroad, and the Meridian,
Brookhaven and Natchez Railroad. The latter road was
acquired in 1891 by the Illinois Central Railroad Co.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>In the spring of 1893 the locomotive was rebuilt at the
McComb, Miss., shops of the Illinois Central and then was
taken under its own power from McComb to Chicago, a distance
of 815 miles. There it was exhibited at the World&rsquo;s
Columbian Exposition. It has since been seen in many
places, including the old Field Museum at Chicago, the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904, the Semicentennial
of Wheeling, W. Va., held in June 1913, and the Chicago
World&rsquo;s Fair in 1933 and 1934. The tender usually seen with
the locomotive and marked &ldquo;Natchez &amp; Hamburg R. R.&rdquo;
is not the original one, but is of a considerably later period.</p>
<p>The <i>Mississippi</i> is a wood burner, weighs 7 tons, has wheels
43 inches in diameter, and, according to Sinclair, has cylinders
with a bore and stroke of 9&frac12; and 16 inches. Its tractive
force is said to be 4,821 pounds.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 49.&mdash;Full sized operable replica of <i>Lafayette</i>, built in 1927 by Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Co.</p>
</div>
<p>An operable replica (<a href="#fig49">figure 49</a>) of another locomotive of
the same period also exists. The <i>Lafayette</i>, built in 1837 by
William Norris of Philadelphia, was the first Baltimore and
Ohio locomotive to have either a horizontal boiler or six
wheels. As B &amp; O <i>No. 13</i>, with a 4-2-0 wheel arrangement,
it represented the first stage of the transition from the old
4-wheeled vertical-boiler types. It was the first of a group of
eight ordered from Norris and was placed on the road in
April 1837.</p>
<p>According to the railroad historian J. Snowden Bell, these
locomotives were known as &ldquo;one-armed Billys,&rdquo; a term derived
from the name of the builder and the single connecting
rod on each side. Some of them were in service with light
local passenger trains as late as 1857, but by 1839 it had
been realized that they could not meet the rapidly increasing
requirements of the expanding B &amp; O railroad system.
As a result, only the eight &ldquo;one-armed Billys&rdquo; were bought
by the company, and as early as September 1839 the road
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
introduced on its lines the more advanced 4-4-0, or American-type
locomotive&mdash;the second stage of transition from
the old &ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo; and &ldquo;crabs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The replica of the <i>Lafayette</i> has one pair of 42-inch driving
wheels, and a leading truck with four 29-inch wheels, although
the diameters of the wheels of the original were 48
inches and 30 inches, respectively. It looks somewhat like the
Chicago and North Western&rsquo;s Baldwin-built <i>Pioneer</i>, but
whereas it was Baldwin&rsquo;s practice to locate the driving axle
behind the firebox, the Norris engine had it located ahead.
This feature gave the Norris 4-2-0&rsquo;s greater adhesion and
tractive force. The <i>Lafayette</i> replica, with a wheelbase of
112&frac34; inches and a weight of 29,200 pounds, has a tractive
force of 2,323 pounds. Its cylinders have a 9-inch bore and
an 18-inch stroke, and it operates on a steam pressure of 90
pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>The replica was built in 1927 for the Fair of the Iron
Horse and later appeared at the Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair in
1933 and 1934, the New York World&rsquo;s Fair in 1939 and
1940, and the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948 and 1949. It
has also been taken several times to the west coast, where it
has been used in the filming of motion pictures. In the fall of
1955 it was used in northern Georgia in a film based on the
story of the famous Civil War locomotive <i>General</i> (see <a href="#Page_84">p. 84</a>).</p>
<p>For many years the replica carried the nameplate <i>William
Galloway</i>, this name having been given it shortly after it was
built, to honor a famous early locomotive engineer of the
Baltimore and Ohio. Today, bearing the correct nameplate,
the <i>Lafayette</i> is usually to be seen at the B &amp; O Museum in
Baltimore.</p>

</div>
<p>The second oldest of the three complete British locomotives
of the 1825-1849 period extant in North America is the
<i>Rocket</i> (<a href="#fig50">figure 50</a>), built in early 1838 for the Philadelphia
and Reading Rail Road Co. by Braithwaite<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> of London. It
was the first of eight Braithwaite locomotives purchased by
that railroad between 1838 and 1841.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>The <i>Rocket</i> was the third of the Reading&rsquo;s locomotives,
having been preceded by the Baldwin-built <i>Neversink</i> in August
1836 and the Winans-built <i>Delaware</i> in January 1838.
It was delivered at Philadelphia by boat in March 1838, and
was then carried up the Schuylkill Canal to the foot of Penn
Street in Reading. From there it was hauled by team to the
terminus of the Reading-to-Pottstown line at Seventh and
Penn Streets, where it participated in the opening of this
portion of the road in May 1838. It was first used in passenger
service in July 1838, but in 1845, as the need grew for
heavier motive power, it was relegated to the Construction
and Roadway Department, where it remained in service
until 1865. Next used for a short time to move and assort
cars at Reading, it was finally transferred to the wharves at
Port Richmond, Philadelphia, where it worked until retirement
in March 1879, covering during its career some
310,164 miles.</p>

stages of its life as <i>P &amp; R locomotive No. 1</i>. Note absence of builder&rsquo;s plate.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Rocket</i> was constructed as a wood burner, but in 1862
was modified to burn anthracite coal. At that time it was
also converted into a tank locomotive, a cab was added, and,
it is now thought, the original wheels were replaced by the
standard Philadelphia and Reading wheels shown in <a href="#fig51">figure 51</a>.
Its present wheels, undoubtedly installed when the locomotive
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
was refurbished in 1893, are 49&frac12; inches in diameter
and contain 20 round metal spokes staggered around the
hub. Published descriptions of the <i>Rocket</i> refer to 41&frac34;-inch
wheels, but this figure probably applies to an earlier set, possibly
that installed in 1862. The <i>Rocket</i> was formerly driven
by all four wheels, but today only the rear two wheels are
drivers.</p>
<p>The cylinders of the locomotive, which are inside, have a
10&frac12;-inch bore and a 16-inch stroke. The wheelbase is 58
inches and the weight was originally 8.4 tons. This was
raised during the 1862 rebuilding to 11.8 tons. The gauge is
standard&mdash;56&frac12; inches. The present smokestack is not original,
and a headlight was not installed until recent years.
The tank and cab added in 1862, as well as the bell, were
removed at the time of the refurbishment.</p>
<p>After its retirement in 1879, the <i>Rocket</i> stood neglected at
Reading until it was placed in condition for exhibition and
permanent preservation at the time of the World&rsquo;s Columbian
Exposition in 1893. It was exhibited in 1904 at St.
Louis, and then was housed for many years in the Reading&rsquo;s
Columbia Avenue station in Philadelphia. It appeared at
the Fair of the Iron Horse in 1927 (<a href="#fig52">figure 52</a>), after which it
was taken to the Reading Terminal in Philadelphia. In October
1933 the <i>Rocket</i> was lent to The Franklin Institute in
Philadelphia, where it has since remained on exhibition.</p>

<p>The third and last of the three complete British locomotives
of the 1825-1849 period remaining in North America
is also the only extant locomotive of the period on this continent
located outside the United States.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The <i>Samson</i> (<a href="#fig53">figure 53</a>) was built by Timothy Hackworth
at New Shildon, Durham, England, in the summer of 1838,
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
at a cost of about $10,000, for the General Mining Association
of Nova Scotia. (Despite statements that the <i>Albion</i>, also
preserved in Nova Scotia, was built by Hackworth before
1840, it was actually built by Rayne and Burn in Newcastle
in 1854.)</p>
<p>The <i>Samson</i> was not, as has so often been claimed, the first
locomotive in Canada. It had been preceded in 1836 by the
Stephenson-built <i>Dorchester</i> employed on the Champlain and
St. Lawrence Railroad, running between St. Johns and
Laprairie, south of Montreal. The <i>Dorchester</i> exploded and
was demolished near Joliette in 1864. Also antedating the
<i>Samson</i> was the <i>Jason C. Pierce</i>, built in 1837 by William
Norris for the same railroad, and destroyed in a fire in about
1890.</p>
<p>The <i>Samson</i> was one of three identical Hackworth locomotives
built for the General Mining Association, whose
railroad was known unofficially as the Albion Mines Railway,
and the South Pictou Railroad. Each had an 0-6-0
wheel arrangement, 56&frac12;-inch gauge, 48-inch cast iron plate
wheels, and vertical cylinders with a bore and stroke of 15&frac14;
and 18 inches. Each weighed 17 tons. The other two, the
<i>John Buddle</i> and the <i>Hercules</i>, were scrapped in 1885 and
1892, respectively.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 54.&mdash;<i>Samson</i> at Chicago in 1883, during Exposition of Railway Appliances.
George Davidson, long its engineer, stands at controls on right.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Samson</i> made a trial run in December 1838, and was
put into regular service on September 19, 1839, hauling cars
of coal from the Albion mines at Stellarton to the harbor at
Pictou, a distance of about 6 miles. According to one early
report, a train of 30 coal cars, weighing 3 tons each, was the
usual load pulled to the harbor. The <i>Samson</i> made about 3
round trips a day at a speed of a little less than 10 miles an
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
hour. This same report states that up to 1856 the locomotive
operated on a steam pressure of 70 pounds per square inch,
and thereafter, until it was taken out of service in the early
1880&rsquo;s, on 45 pounds.</p>
<p>The locomotive was operated in an unusual manner. The
engineer was stationed at one end, adjacent to the cylinders
and driving gear, while the fireman was located at the other
end, from which the boiler was fired.</p>
<p>The boiler is about 13 feet long and 4 feet in diameter, and
has a large U-shaped return flue. The cylinders are mounted
vertically at the rear, and the piston rods are guided by
Watt&rsquo;s parallel motion instead of the usual cross heads and
slide bars. The engine has no frame, the axle bearings being
bolted to brackets riveted to the under side of the boiler.
Only the front and middle axle bearings are fitted with
springs.</p>
<p>In the course of its working career, the <i>Samson</i> traveled
considerably. In addition to having been brought across the
Atlantic, the old locomotive was brought to Chicago in 1883
for display at the Exposition of Railway Appliances (<a href="#fig54">figure 54</a>).
There it was accompanied by George Davidson, long its
engineer and said to have come with it to Nova Scotia from
England.</p>

</div>
<p>Ten years later, in 1893, it was again brought to Chicago,
this time to be exhibited at the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition.
At the conclusion of the exposition the <i>Samson</i>, and the
<i>Albion</i> that had accompanied it, were taken by the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Co. to Baltimore for preservation there.
The B &amp; O later included the <i>Samson</i> (and also the <i>Albion</i>) in
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
the exhibition of historic locomotives at the Fair of the Iron
Horse in 1927 (<a href="#fig55">figure 55</a>).</p>
<p>In June 1928, when the two old locomotives were given by
the B &amp; O to the Province of Nova Scotia, the <i>Samson</i> returned
to the land of its youth, only to be placed in storage
in Halifax. Later, however, it was given to the town of New
Glasgow, through which it had run almost daily in its early
days, and it is now housed in a small building especially
constructed for it at the town&rsquo;s railroad station.</p>
<h3 id="c13">The Final Decade</h3>
<p>In 1839 the Philadelphia locomotive building firm of
Eastwick and Harrison constructed to the order of Moncure
Robinson for the Philadelphia and Reading Rail Road Co.
a noteworthy anthracite-burning locomotive, named the
<i>Gowan and Marx</i> after an English banking firm. This engine
during trials on February 20, 1840, turned in what was for
the time an outstanding performance. It hauled from Reading
to the inclined plane on the Columbia and Philadelphia
Rail Road, located several miles from Vine and Broad
Streets in Philadelphia, 101 cars of freight, a load of 423 long
tons (2,240 pounds). The total weight of this load was
947,520 pounds not including the weight of the engine itself
and its tender. The engine, in running order, weighed 24,660
pounds. The story of this remarkable feat is told by Joseph
Harrison, Jr., in his book, &ldquo;The Locomotive Engine, and
Philadelphia&rsquo;s Share in Its Early Improvements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So pleased was the Philadelphia and Reading with this
locomotive that the road decided to order more of the same
general style. However, as Eastwick and Harrison shortly
became involved with plans to construct locomotives in
Russia, and contemplated closing their Philadelphia works,
most of these additional locomotives were made by other
builders. A dozen or so, somewhat similar to the <i>Gowan and
Marx</i>, were built in the machine shop of a Lowell, Mass.,
firm named &ldquo;Proprietors of Locks and Canals on Merrimack
River.&rdquo; Others were built by the New Castle Manufacturing
Co. at New Castle, Del.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>At least two, however, the <i>Boston</i> and the <i>J. E. Thayer</i>, were
built by Eastwick and Harrison, and placed in service on the
Philadelphia and Reading in September and October,
respectively, of 1842.</p>
<p>What is thought to be one of these now famous locomotives
has survived (<a href="#fig56">figure 56</a>). It is the earliest extant 4-4-0,
or American type. Known today as the <i>Peoples&rsquo; Railway No. 3</i>,
it was obtained at fourth or fifth hand in about 1872 by the
Peoples&rsquo; Railway, which was then establishing a line from
the York Street station at Pottsville to Minersville, Pa., a distance
of about 4&frac12; miles. Seldom used by the Peoples&rsquo; Railway
after 1883, it was obtained by the Reading Co. in the
early 1920&rsquo;s when that road took over some of the rolling
stock of the Peoples&rsquo; Railway. Since October 1933 it has
been on loan to The Franklin Institute in Philadelphia,
where it is exhibited with the Braithwaite-built <i>Rocket</i> of
1838, also owned by the Reading Co.</p>
<p>The <i>No. 3</i> has been the subject of much speculation and
investigation since it was obtained by the Reading. Its origin
and the name of its builder are not definitely known, nor is
it absolutely certain for whom it was constructed. Without
question, however, it is of the period of the early 1840&rsquo;s, and
is similar in appearance to the famous <i>Gowan and Marx</i>,
although of considerably longer wheelbase.</p>
<p>Paul T. Warner, for many years writer and historian for
the Baldwin Locomotive Works, conducted an intensive examination
of the <i>No. 3</i>, and in January 1934 prepared a
thorough paper on his findings, based on a careful comparison
of the <i>No. 3</i> with contemporary drawings of the various
other locomotives, and on a comparison of its dimensions
with those still known of the others.</p>
<p>He concluded that from the information at hand it was not
possible to state positively which, if any, of these locomotives
it was, or even if it had been built for the Philadelphia and
Reading. Similar engines, he pointed out, had also been
built by Eastwick and Harrison for other railroads in eastern
Pennsylvania, among them the Beaver Meadow Rail Road
and Coal Co. and the Hazelton (sic) and Lehigh Rail Road.
The <i>No. 3</i> could easily have been built for one of these roads
before falling into the possession of the Peoples&rsquo; Railway,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
particularly since it is known to have had a number of prior
owners.</p>
<p>It was Warner&rsquo;s opinion, however, that if it had originally
been a Philadelphia and Reading engine, it was more likely
to have been either the <i>Boston</i> or the <i>J. E. Thayer</i> of Eastwick
and Harrison rather than a locomotive built by another
firm, of which the Lowell-built <i>Conestoga</i> of 1842 had been
considered by some to be the chief possibility.</p>
<p>At first glance the <i>No. 3</i> appears much more modern than
its actual age, but this is mainly because it has the 4-4-0
wheel arrangement with which people today are more familiar.
The cab, not original, is of a design similar to that used
on the <i>Pawnee</i> class of engines first built at the Reading shops
in 1852. Also not original are the headlight, the sandboxes,
and the truck wheels. Sandboxes worked from the cab were
not used in this country prior to 1846; the truck wheels, 30
inches in diameter, are of cast iron, manufactured by A.
Whitney &amp; Sons of Philadelphia, whose wheel foundry was
established in 1846. The smokestack has obviously been
altered, if not replaced entirely.</p>
<p>The <i>No. 3</i>, now an anthracite-burning locomotive, is
thought to have been originally a wood burner. The firebox
is of the Bury type, which was in common use up to 1850.</p>
<p>The four driving wheels of the <i>No. 3</i> are 42&frac12; inches in
diameter, the extreme wheelbase is 178 inches, and the distance
between the two driving axles is 55&frac12; inches. The inclined
cylinders are connected by long rods to the rear
drivers. The exact cylinder bore, which had not been known
for many years, was measured in October 1954 by representatives
of the Reading Co. and found to be 12&frac34; inches. The
stroke is 18 inches.</p>
<p>The type of reversing mechanism designed by Andrew M.
Eastwick in 1835 is thought to have been originally applied,
and it is also thought that the original steam chests are still
on the locomotive. The old valve gear has been replaced by a
double-eccentric motion, the two eccentric rods being respectively
attached to the top and bottom of a straight link.
When the new motion was applied, the old reversing blocks
were removed from the steam chests and discarded, the new
valves being placed directly on the valve seats. This made it
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
necessary to use only the lower stuffing boxes for the valve
rods, and so the upper openings were permanently closed by
suitable fittings. There are but two positions for the reverse
lever, as was the case with the original valve gear, and the
valves are always worked full stroke.</p>
<p>The absence of definitive facts concerning the early history
of the <i>No. 3</i> is challenging, and it would add much to railroad
history if in the near future the complete story could
be developed as a result of further study of the locomotive
itself, and of the written records.</p>
<p>Of the many hundreds of locomotives built by Holmes
Hinkley, the only one extant is the interesting old <i>Lion</i> (<a href="#fig57">figure 57</a>),
built in 1846 in Boston at the Hinkley and Drury
plant. It is not Hinkley&rsquo;s first locomotive, as has often been
said, nor is it his first <i>Lion</i>, as his 22d locomotive, built in
1844 for the Nashua and Lowell Railroad, also bore that
name.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill57">

<p class="pcap">Figure 56.&mdash;Controversial <i>Peoples&rsquo; Railway No. 3</i>, built in the 1840&rsquo;s, as it

</div>
<p>The second <i>Lion</i>, now preserved in the Crosby Mechanical
Laboratory at the University of Maine at Orono, Maine,
was built for the Machiasport Railroad (later called the
Whitneyville and Machiasport Railroad) running between
the towns of Whitneyville and Machiasport in Maine.
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
Strictly a lumber road about 7&frac12; miles long, it was abandoned
in the early 1890&rsquo;s when lumber became scarce in that
region. The <i>Lion</i> and a similar but slightly older Hinkley
locomotive, the <i>Tiger</i>, fell into disuse, and were subsequently
sold as junk to Thomas Towle of Portland. What happened
to the <i>Tiger</i> is today not known, but quite probably it was
broken up for scrap.</p>
<p>Alderman E. E. Rounds of Portland succeeded in raising
funds to acquire the <i>Lion</i> for exhibition in the Fourth of July
parade held in Portland in 1898. It then remained in Portland
on city property until 1905 when, through the efforts of
Alderman Rounds, the President and alumni of the University
of Maine, and friends of the University, it was shipped
to the University to be preserved as a museum piece. Once
on the campus it was stored in various places and received
little attention, until it was moved in 1929 to the then newly
completed Crosby Mechanical Laboratory.</p>

what is probably the Portland, Maine, junkyard from which it was rescued in

</div>
<p>As the result of a study made in the fall of 1929, some
missing parts of the <i>Lion</i> were replaced, and it was restored to
the point where it can now be operated on compressed air.
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
Today the locomotive, jacked up so that its four wheels can
be made to operate, is a valued relic at the University of
Maine (<a href="#fig58">figure 58</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>It has been stated that the <i>Lion</i> cost $2,700, exclusive of
the tender. The bore and stroke of its cylinders are 9&frac14; inches
and 17 inches, respectively, and the diameter of the four
wheels is approximately 42&frac12; inches. The gauge is standard,
56&frac12; inches. The locomotive alone weighs 9 tons.</p>
<p>The final survivor of this group of early locomotives is the
<i>Memnon</i> (<a href="#fig59">figure 59</a>), built for the Baltimore and Ohio in 1848
by the New Castle Manufacturing Co., New Castle, Del.,
under subcontract to Matthias W. Baldwin. It is one of a
small group of similar freight engines built by Baldwin, who
won the contract as a result of his bid in reply to a B &amp; O
advertisement in the &ldquo;American Railroad Journal&rdquo; of
October 1847.</p>
<p>The design of the <i>Memnon</i> class of locomotives followed
closely that of the <i>Dragon</i>, a slightly smaller locomotive built
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
by Baldwin in late 1847 and placed on the road in January
1848. All had an 0-8-0 wheel arrangement, and were intended
for heavy-duty work with freight trains. The general
design of these locomotives had been originated by Baldwin
in 1846 in an order of freight engines built by him for the
Philadelphia and Reading.</p>
<p>The <i>Memnon</i> type of engine had four coupled driving
wheels on each side, and early reports give their diameter
as 43 inches. Today&rsquo;s measurement of the <i>Memnon</i> reveals the
diameter of its wheels, undoubtedly replacements, to be only
41 inches. The wheels on the two center axles are unflanged,
the better to negotiate curves of limited radius with its wheelbase
of 135 inches (in 1847 the shortest curve on the B &amp; O
had a 400-foot radius).</p>
<p>The inclined cylinders have a 17-inch bore and a 22-inch
stroke, and the valve gear is of the Gooch stationary link
type. The <i>Memnon</i> is now operated on a steam pressure of 65
pounds per square inch, although it originally operated
on 100.</p>

<p>The original specifications, as set forth in the B &amp; O advertisement,
called for a locomotive weight not to exceed 20
tons (of 2,240 pounds). According to J. Snowden Bell, the
weight amounted to about 52,000 pounds at first, but
changes reduced it to about 47,000 pounds. It would be
interesting to know what parts, unnecessary enough to justify
their removal or so sturdy that they could be drastically
lightened, were involved in changes that reduced the total
weight by 5,000 pounds. Today, the unloaded weight of the
engine and tender together is 74,700 pounds. The tractive
force is 8,580 pounds. As was true of the Baldwin-built
<i>Pioneer</i>, the cowcatcher of the <i>Memnon</i> was not installed
originally.</p>
<p>This class of locomotive, which burned bituminous coal,
introduced to the B &amp; O the grate having a rocking bar in
the center, with fingers on each side that interlocked with
projections on fixed bars in front and behind. The rocking
bar operated from the footboard.</p>
<p>The <i>Memnon</i> has appeared with other engines in the historic
collection of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at many
expositions, fairs, and railroad pageants. Its permanent home
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
is now that railroad&rsquo;s transportation museum at Baltimore.
Originally numbered <i>57</i>, the <i>Memnon</i> was renumbered <i>13</i> on
January 1, 1884 (<a href="#fig60">figure 60</a>), and when on exhibition at
St. Louis in 1904 it was incorrectly labeled <i>Dragon</i>.</p>
<p>Today, however, bearing its correct name and number, it
stands on the roster as the oldest of all extant B &amp; O freight
locomotives, as well as the last of the locomotives to have survived
the first quarter-century of railroading in North
America.</p>

<h2 id="c14">SUPPLEMENT
<br />Models, in the National Museum, of Locomotives Not Included in This Work</h2>
<p>Certain of the locomotives, locomotive parts, and models
described in the foregoing pages have been noted as being in
the collection of the United States National Museum. In
addition to these, the collection of the Museum includes 21
models of locomotives that do not fall into the scope of this
work, as the originals they represent are either no longer in
existence, are of too recent vintage, or were not used in
North America. Among them are five operable models&mdash;four
steam and one electric.</p>
<p>The originals represented by many of these models were
involved in notable events in the history of railroading or
mark major steps in its progress. For these reasons, and in
order to provide the reader with a complete catalog of the
locomotive collection of the United States National Museum,
a brief description of each will be given on the pages that
follow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<h4 title="">Trevithick Locomotive, 1804</h4>
<p>The National Museum&rsquo;s nonoperable model shown in
figure 61 represents the probable form of the first rail
locomotive of Richard Trevithick, the Cornish engineer who
was one of the early advocates of the high-pressure steam
engine. The Museum&rsquo;s model (USNM 180058) is about 20
inches in length, and its flywheel is about 10 inches in diameter.
It was obtained in 1888 from its builder D. Ballauf, a
model maker often employed by the Museum.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill62">

<p class="pcap">Figure 61.&mdash;Model of Trevithick locomotive, 1804.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>Trevithick, who a few years earlier had constructed several
successful steam vehicles for use on the highways, in
February 1804 completed the construction of a machine at
Pen-y-darran, near Merthyr Tydfil, Glamorganshire, Wales,
for use at the Pen-y-darran Iron Works of Samuel Homfray.
It is thought to have been the first steam locomotive ever
propelled along a railway.</p>
<p>The first trip was made on Monday, February 13, 1804.
Among the several trips made by the locomotive was one of
9 miles, between Merthyr Tydfil and Abercynon, drawing
5 cars with a load of 10 tons of iron and 70 men. Although
a satisfactory machine, and one that proved that a useful
load could be hauled through the adhesion of wheels on
smooth track, it was not long in use because of frequent
breakage of the primitive railway.</p>
<p>The single horizontal steam cylinder, projecting partly
into the end of the boiler, operated a crankshaft fitted with a
large-diameter flywheel. The driving wheels were coupled to
the crankshaft by gearing. The bore and stroke of the cylinder
are said to have been about 8&frac14; and 54 inches, respectively,
and the unflanged wheels were about 45 inches in
diameter. Discharge of the exhaust steam into the chimney
was utilized with this particular locomotive, as Trevithick
appreciated fully the effect it had upon the fire. The date of
this early use of exhaust steam to aid the fire greatly
antedates those claimed for later locomotive builders.</p>
<h4 title="">Trevithick Locomotive Catch-me-who-can, 1808</h4>
<p>Trevithick&rsquo;s next best known locomotive, his <i>Catch-me-who-can</i>,
is represented in the national collection by a 9-inch-long
nonoperable model (USNM 244889). The model (figure 62)
was transferred to the Museum from the U. S. Department
of the Interior in 1906. Nothing further is known of its origin.</p>
<p>The original <i>Catch-me-who-can</i>, built for Trevithick by
Hazeldine and Rastrick of Bridgnorth, was exhibited in the
summer of 1808 in London on a small circular railway laid
down on part of the ground now occupied by Euston Square.
The public was charged admission to enter a small enclosure
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
to view the demonstration or ride in a small car pulled by the
locomotive.</p>
<p>As on his 1804 locomotive, a single cylinder projecting
partly within the end of the boiler was used, but it was vertical
instead of horizontal. The rear wheels only were driven,
actuated by long, return connecting rods attached to the
ends of a wide crosshead. Because of the necessary arrangement
of the cranks on the ends of the rear axle, it was entirely
possible for the engine to stop on dead center. This was
likewise a fault of the 1804 locomotive, which had a single
crank.</p>
<p>The engine is said to have weighed 8 tons and to have
traveled at a speed of 12 miles an hour, but troubles with the
track ultimately brought the demonstrations to a halt. No
dimensions are known today of the original <i>Catch-me-who-can</i>,
which has long since disappeared.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<h4 title="">Stephenson Locomotive Rocket, 1829</h4>
<p>Probably the most famous of Robert Stephenson&rsquo;s many
locomotives, the <i>Rocket</i>, winner of the Rainhill Trials in
October 1829, is represented in the Museum collection by
a nonoperable model (<a href="#fig63">figure 63</a>) that, with its tender, is a
little less than 1&frac12; feet long. The model was transferred to
the Museum (USNM 244890) from the U. S. Department
of the Interior in 1906.</p>
<p>The original <i>Rocket</i>, the considerably altered remains of
which now appear on exhibition in the Science Museum at
South Kensington, was constructed by Stephenson at Newcastle-upon-Tyne
to compete for the &pound;500 prize offered by
the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The <i>Rocket</i> turned
out to be the only one of the five competing machines to
finish the trials. Its success was especially important because
it showed beyond doubt that steam locomotives were suitable
for general railway work, and also because they could attain
speeds not previously known. Running with a light load, it
reached a speed of 29 miles an hour.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill64">
<img id="fig63" src="images/p035a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="553" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 63.&mdash;Model of Stephenson <i>Rocket</i>, 1829.</p>
</div>
<p>The locomotive weighed 3&frac14; tons empty and 4&frac14; tons in
working order. It had two inclined cylinders of 8-inch bore
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
and 17-inch stroke and two 56&frac12;-inch-diameter driving
wheels at the front. A tubular boiler suggested by Henry
Booth, the secretary and treasurer of the Liverpool and
Manchester Railway, is said to have contributed greatly to
the success of the <i>Rocket</i> during the trials. It must not be forgotten,
however, that in America John Stevens had used
successfully a tubular boiler in his experimental locomotive
in 1825.</p>
<p>The <i>Rocket</i> was used on the Liverpool and Manchester
Railway until 1836, and from then until 1844 on the Midgeholme
Railway near Carlisle. It was presented to the Science
Museum in 1862, where it is now an outstanding exhibit in
the railroad collection.</p>
<p>J. G. H. Warren&rsquo;s history of Robert Stephenson &amp; Co.,
which contains detailed and well illustrated accounts of the
<i>Rocket</i> and of the Rainhill Trials, will interest those seeking
further details on either subject.</p>
<h4 title="">Baldwin Locomotive Old Ironsides, 1832</h4>
<p>The locomotive <i>Old Ironsides</i> is represented in the Museum&rsquo;s
collection by a nonoperable model (<a href="#fig64">figure 64</a>) that,
with its tender, is 3 feet long. The model (USNM 180114)
was given to the Museum in 1889 by Burnham, Parry,
Williams &amp; Co., who were then proprietors of the Baldwin
Locomotive Works.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill65">
<img id="fig64" src="images/p036.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="445" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 64.&mdash;Model of Baldwin <i>Old Ironsides</i>, 1832.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>The original <i>Old Ironsides</i> was the first full sized locomotive
built by Matthias W. Baldwin, a jeweler turned machinist,
of Philadelphia. It was constructed for the Philadelphia,
Germantown, and Norristown Rail-Road Co.,
which had been using horse cars in operating a short line of
only 6 miles between Philadelphia and Germantown.</p>
<p>The line&rsquo;s first locomotive, <i>Old Ironsides</i>, was initially operated
on the road on November 23, 1832, and was a success
from the start, though a few understandable imperfections
were noted during the trials and shortly corrected. The fairly
new locomotive <i>John Bull</i> of the Camden and Amboy Rail
Road and Transportation Co. had been inspected by
Baldwin before he undertook the project. Undoubtedly it
furnished helpful suggestions to the man whose locomotive
building enterprise was ultimately to eclipse anything
possibly dreamed of by him.</p>
<p>The locomotive, contracted for at $4,000 but for which
Baldwin was, after some difficulty, able to collect only $3,500,
was somewhat similar to the locomotives of the English
<i>Planet</i> class quite popular at the time. The two driving
wheels, located at the rear, were larger than the carrying
ones at the front, the diameters being 54 and 45 inches,
respectively. The two cylinders had a bore of 9&frac12; inches and
a stroke of 18. The exhaust steam was discharged into the
chimney in order to increase the draft. The boiler, 30 inches
in diameter, contained 72 copper tubes 1&frac12; inches in
diameter and 7 feet long.</p>
<p>A complete description of <i>Old Ironsides</i> and detailed accounts
of its first trials are to be found in &ldquo;History of the
Baldwin Locomotive Works, 1831-1923.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 title="">Davis and Gartner Locomotive Arabian, 1834</h4>
<p>Davis and Gartner, who built the <i>Atlantic</i> in 1832 for the
Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road (see <a href="#Page_47">p. 47</a>), built as their
next two &ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo; the <i>Traveller</i> and the <i>Arabian</i>. The
latter of these was placed in service on the B &amp; O in July
1834. Neither of these two locomotives is extant, but a 2-foot-long
nonoperable model of the <i>Arabian</i> (<a href="#fig65">figure 65</a>) is now in
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the National Museum collection (USNM 233511). It was
made in the Museum in about 1900 by C. R. Luscombe.</p>
<p>The <i>Arabian</i> was similar in design to the three &ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo;
that have survived, but differed from them in
many small ways. Its two cylinders, for example, had a bore
and stroke of 12 and 22 inches. This bore was fractionally
less than that of the other three. Also, its weight with fuel
and water, 7&frac12; tons, was about a ton less than that of any
of the others.</p>
<p>The extent to which the Museum&rsquo;s model represents these
slight differences between the <i>Arabian</i> and the &ldquo;grasshoppers&rdquo;
that followed it cannot now be determined. Most
of these differences would be impossible to reproduce on
such a small scale. It is entirely possible that the model represented
no particular &ldquo;grasshopper,&rdquo; and the name <i>Arabian</i>
may have been selected by chance.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the construction of the <i>Arabian</i>
and a discussion of its performance characteristics appear in
the eighth (1834) and ninth (1835) annual reports of the
Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Co.</p>

<h4 title="">Rogers, Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor Locomotive Sandusky, 1837</h4>
<p>The <i>Sandusky</i>, first locomotive built by the firm of Rogers,
Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor of Paterson, N. J., is represented in
the Museum&rsquo;s collection by a 2-foot-long nonoperable model
(<a href="#fig66">figure 66</a>) of the locomotive and its tender. The model
(USNM 180245) was built for the Museum in 1888 by
D. Ballauf.</p>
<p>Notice of the firm&rsquo;s intention to produce locomotives was
given in the &ldquo;American Railroad Journal&rdquo; for December 24,
1836, and the original <i>Sandusky</i> was constructed during the
following year. Intended for the New Jersey Railroad and
Transportation Co., it was built to the gauge of that road&mdash;58
inches. However, after a trial trip on October 6 between
Paterson and New Brunswick, it was purchased for the Mad
River and Lake Erie Railroad by that road&rsquo;s president,
J. H. James of Urbana, Ohio.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill67">
<img id="fig66" src="images/p037a.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="464" />
<p class="pcap">Figure 66.&mdash;Model of Rogers, Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor <i>Sandusky</i>, 1837.</p>
</div>
<p>It was delivered to Sandusky, Ohio, on November 17, at
which time not a foot of track had been laid. The engine was
used in the construction of the road, which in consequence
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
was built to the gauge of the engine. This fact has been given
as the reason why the legislature of Ohio at one time passed
an act requiring all railroads built in Ohio to be of 58-inch
gauge. On April 11, 1838, regular trips for the conveyance
of passengers commenced between Bellevue and Sandusky,
a distance of 16 miles, and the locomotive <i>Sandusky</i> was used.</p>
<p>The <i>Sandusky</i> resembled the early Stephenson engines in
some respects, but differed principally in having a 4-wheeled
leading truck, the wheels of which were 30 inches in diameter.
The two driving wheels, made of cast iron and with
hollow spokes and rims, were 54 inches in diameter. The
crankshaft throws were counterbalanced by a method of
balancing devised by Thomas Rogers, who had filed a patent
application on it dated July 12, 1837. This consisted of having
the part of the wheel rim opposite the crank throw cast
solid, while the rest of the rim was hollow.</p>
<p>The driving wheels and the inclined 11- by 16-inch cylinders
were inside the frame, whereas the eccentric rods,
working off the outer ends of the driving axle, were outside.
The bonnet-type smokestack had a deflecting cone in its
center and a wire mesh on the top to prevent the escape of
sparks.</p>
<h4 title="">Rogers, Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor Locomotive General, 1855</h4>
<p>The smallest locomotive model in the National Museum
(<a href="#fig67">figure 67</a>) is of the wood-burning locomotive <i>General</i> that
figured so prominently in the famous Civil War locomotive
chase of April 12, 1862. (In William Pittenger&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Great
Locomotive Chase&rdquo; is told the complete story of this epic
adventure, which took place when a group of Northern
raiders stole the <i>General</i> and its train at Big Shanty, Ga. The
Confederates finally recaptured the <i>General</i> minus the cars,
which had been cut loose to delay the pursuers, but with
most of the raiders, after a thrilling pursuit that led them 90
miles away, to Ringgold, Ga., just south of Chattanooga,
Tenn.)</p>
<p>The Museum&rsquo;s display is constructed from a pair of model
kits, to which a great many engineering details have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
added. It shows two beautifully made reproductions, scaled
&#8539; inch to the foot, passing in opposite directions on a slight
curve. Each is 7 inches long. The builder, Adolph H. Schutz
of Washington, D. C., in 1955 presented the model to the
Museum (USNM 313724), where it had been on exhibit as
a loan since 1951.</p>
<p>Built by the Rogers, Ketchum &amp; Grosvenor plant at
Paterson, N. J., in 1855, the original <i>General</i> was used on the
Western and Atlantic Railroad for many years. It is now on
permanent exhibit at Chattanooga in the Union Station of
the Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railway. A 4-4-0, or
American type, it is the earliest of this particular type
represented in the Museum&rsquo;s collection of models.</p>

<h4 title="">American-Type Locomotive of about 1890</h4>
<p>An operable model (<a href="#fig68">figure 68</a>) in the Museum&rsquo;s collection
(USNM 309515), appears to represent a New York
Central and Hudson River Railroad 4-4-0 locomotive of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
period of about 1890. This class of locomotive was built by
the Schenectady Locomotive Works to the New York Central&rsquo;s
design, and had 78-inch driving wheels, cylinders with
a bore of 19 inches and a stroke of 24 inches, and weighed
120,000 pounds.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill69">

<p class="pcap">Figure 68.&mdash;Operable model of an American-type locomotive of about 1890.</p>
</div>
<p>Work on this model was commenced by the donor, the late
Robert E. M. Bain, in 1916, and it was completed about
three years later, only spare time having been employed in
its construction. The model was given to the Museum in
1928. The length of the locomotive and tender is 80 inches,
the gauge is 6&frac12; inches, the diameter of the driving wheels is
8&#8313;/&#8321;&#8326; inches, and the bore and stroke of the cylinders are 1&frac12;
and 3 inches, respectively.</p>
<p>The brakes on the model are inoperative, as the actuating
cylinders for the brake system are dummies. On the other
hand, such parts as the boiler, firebox, steam gauge, water
gauge, throttle, and valve motion are all operable, and the
donor has asserted that there is even ring packing in the cylinders.
Although capable of being fired and steamed up,
using coal as the fuel, the locomotive has never been
operated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The number on the locomotive and tender apparently
represent the year the donor commenced his work on the
model, as there was never a New York Central locomotive
of this type bearing that number.</p>
<h4 title="">New York Central Locomotive 999, 1893</h4>
<p>The Museum&rsquo;s nonoperable model (<a href="#fig69">figure 69</a>) of the
famous <i>999</i>, long the holder of the world&rsquo;s speed record, was
built especially for the Museum&rsquo;s collection (USNM
313161), and was the gift in 1947 of the New York Central
System. Constructed by Edwin P. Alexander of Yardley, Pa.,
it is about 15 inches long with tender and is accompanied by
a train of four model cars of the period. Locomotive and cars
are built to a scale of &frac14; inch to the foot.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill70">

<p class="pcap">Figure 69.&mdash;Model of New York Central American-type locomotive <i>999</i>, 1893.</p>
</div>
<p>One of the best known of all locomotives, the New York
Central and Hudson River Railroad&rsquo;s <i>999</i>, with engineer
Charles H. Hogan at the throttle, reached a speed of 112&frac12;
miles an hour over a measured mile on May 10, 1893, while
pulling the Empire State Express westward between Batavia
and Buffalo, N. Y. This was a new world&rsquo;s record, and the
<i>999</i> was shortly withdrawn from active service and placed
on exhibition at the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition at
Chicago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>At the conclusion of the exposition it was again placed in
service with the Empire State Express, but was later withdrawn
because, although having great speed with a light
train, it lacked the pulling power required for the larger and
heavier trains then coming into use. Today, the <i>999</i>, altered
somewhat, and with smaller driving wheels than when built,
is preserved by the New York Central System as one of its
historic relics. It is usually to be seen at the Collinwood shops
near Cleveland, Ohio, but it still occasionally appears at
fairs and expositions.</p>
<p>Designed by the superintendent of motive power, William
Buchanan, and constructed at the West Albany shops of the
New York Central, the <i>999</i> is of the 4-4-0, or American, type
and was fitted originally with 86-inch driving wheels. The
bore and stroke of the cylinders are 19 and 24 inches, respectively,
and a steam pressure of 180 pounds per square inch
was used. The fuel was bituminous coal. The extreme wheelbase
is 287 inches, and the distance between the two driving
axles is 102 inches. The weight of the locomotive is 124,000
pounds, that of the loaded tender is 80,000.</p>
<h4 title="">American-Type Locomotive of about 1900</h4>
<p>Through the bequest in 1955 of John Semple Clarke, a
model (<a href="#fig70">figure 70</a>) formerly lent by him to the Museum has
been added to the collection (USNM 314615). A 4-4-0 of
exquisite workmanship in brass and steel, the model is 21
inches long and has a gauge of 2&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>It was constructed during the 7-year period from 1907 to
1914 by George Boshart, a toolmaker of Brookline, near
Philadelphia, Pa. All rotating and reciprocating parts are
operable, though the boiler is apparently not capable of
generating steam. There is no tender with the locomotive,
none having been built.</p>
<p>It is not definitely known what, if any, original locomotive
the model represents, but some of its details are similar
to those of locomotives built at the turn of the century
by the Schenectady Locomotive Works. While it has been
stated that Boshart patterned the model after a Pennsylvania
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
Railroad locomotive with which he was familiar, in
certain of its details the model does not appear to justify this
claim. The number on the model represents the year in
which its construction was started.</p>

<p>In the national collection is an operable model (<a href="#fig71">figure 71</a>)
of a British locomotive of the period of about 1905. Made by
the well known English model makers Carson and Co., and

6-wheeled tender is 45 inches and the gauge is 3&frac14; inches.
A locomotive of similar appearance, though not necessarily
identical, is described and illustrated in the British technical
journal &ldquo;Engineering&rdquo; for August 31, 1906 (p. 299).</p>
<p>The elder Wardlaw stated that the model was built by
Carson for Sir Henry Lopes, and that he acquired it from
Carson when Sir Henry turned it in on a new one. Wardlaw
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
believed this gasoline-fueled model to have been the first
model locomotive ever built with a flash boiler.</p>
<p>A letter from James C. Crebbin in the July 27, 1933, issue
of the British journal &ldquo;The Model Engineer and Practical
Electrician,&rdquo; contains the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was chairman of Messrs. Carson and Co., the late Mr.
James Carson and I collaborated in the development of flash
steam model locomotives.</p>
<p>With the exception of the very small model L. &amp; N. W. &ldquo;Experiment&rdquo;
loco which had only one coil, and a methylated vaporising
burner, the boilers had longitudinal coils running the full length
of the boiler, and were fired by means of a Carson Primus type
burner. The pressure container was a drum inside the tender, and
was surrounded by water in the usual square or oblong tank. This
water fed the geared pump, which was driven from the second
tender axle.</p>
<p>The most successful of this type was a &frac34;-inch-scale 4-4-0 Caledonian,
built for Sir Henry Lopes. Mr. Carson always declared
that this engine was the fastest he had ever seen, and during tests
he carried out, on Sir Henry&rsquo;s track, never dared to give the
model more than half-throttle, no matter what load the engine
was hauling.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardlaw, of New York, and a &ldquo;M. E.&rdquo; Exhibition Championship
Cup Holder, has a similar locomotive which, I believe,
is destined for exhibition in some museum in U. S. A.</p>

plate affixed to the model, the original was the first locomotive
to be fitted with &ldquo;Wardlaw&rsquo;s composite clackvalve.&rdquo;
This invention of the elder Wardlaw was installed at Buenos
Aires in January 1908, according to the legend on the plate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>The original <i>Greyhound</i> was locomotive <i>No. 302</i> of the
London and North-Western Railway Co., built in 1905 at
the Crewe works of the company. Of the 4-4-0 type, the
locomotive had inside cylinders and was the first in Europe
to be fitted with &ldquo;Wardlaw&rsquo;s composite clackvalve.&rdquo; This

<h4 title="">Pennsylvania Atlantic-Type Locomotive, 1907</h4>
<p>The Atlantic-type steam locomotive is represented in the
Museum collection by a nonoperable model (<a href="#fig74">figure 74</a>) lent
to the Museum in 1922 by E. Howard Askew of Baltimore,
Md. Constructed by the lender, the model (USNM 307949)
is 32 inches long and has a gauge of 2&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>It represents the Pennsylvania Railroad class E3sd <i>No.
5127</i>, a 4-4-2 steam locomotive with Walschaert valve gear.
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
The original locomotive was built at the railroad&rsquo;s Juniata
shops, Altoona, Pa., in August 1907, construction No. 1734.
Originally a class E3d locomotive, it was converted to an
E3sd in June 1913 by the addition of a superheater in the
Wilmington, Del., shops of the road.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 74.&mdash;Model of Pennsylvania Atlantic-type locomotive, 1907.</p>
</div>
<p>In a letter to Askew (Dec. 14, 1922) the chief of motive
power of the Pennsylvania System, J. T. Wallis, stated that
the cylinders of the original had a bore and stroke of 22 and
26 inches. The drivers were 80 inches in diameter and the
boiler carried a steam pressure of 205 pounds. The boiler
had a minimum (internal) diameter of 65&frac12; inches, and it
contained 170 2-inch flues and 24 5&frac12;-inch flues, while the
superheater consisted of 96 1&frac12;-inch flues. The distance between
flue sheets was 180 inches and the total heating surface
was 2,571 square feet. The grate was 111 inches long and 72
wide.</p>
<p>The total weight on the drivers was 127,200 pounds, on
the engine truck 35,500 pounds, and on the trailer truck
33,900 pounds&mdash;or a total of 196,600 pounds in working
order. The weight of the tender in working order was 134,000
pounds. The tractive force of the locomotive was 27,409
pounds.</p>
<p>In his letter Wallis also made the following statement to
explain the significance of the modification of this class of
locomotive:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The Atlantic, or 4-4-2, type locomotive was developed in an
effort to retain the desirable features of the American, or 4-4-0,
type of locomotive and at the same time to produce a locomotive
in answer to the demand for greater power. To do this, the
firebox was increased in area by making it considerably wider,
so that a greater amount of soft coal could be burned. The diameter
of the barrel of the boiler was increased to allow for greater
heating surface, which, of course, increased the weight on the
drivers.</p>
<p>To make room for the driving wheels without unduly increasing
the length of the tubes in the boiler, the driving wheels were
moved forward, the main driver being in the rear instead of in
front as in the American type locomotive. In order to carry the
weight of the firebox, which, with the new driving wheel location,
overhangs the rear driver too much to be properly supported,
a two-wheel trailer truck was used. This trailer truck,
which is fulcrumed a short distance back of the main driver, is so
designed that it has lateral motion, and provision is made for ash
pan as well as firebox clearance.</p>
<p>By the use of higher steam pressure, larger heating surface and
grate area, the use of passenger locomotives of the three-coupled
type, with the troubles incident to the use of long parallel rods,
was put off for a decade.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 title="">General Electric Locomotive, 1926</h4>
<p>A detailed and exquisitely made operable model of the
New York Central class T-3A electric locomotive <i>No. 1173</i>,
now <i>No. 273</i>, was constructed by W. Howard R. Parsons,
and was donated by him in 1952 to the Museum (USNM
314237).</p>
<p>The model (<a href="#fig75">figure 75</a>) is powered by eight electric motors,
as is the full sized original, one for each axle, but because of
space limitations and power requirements the model&rsquo;s drive
is through gears rather than direct. The model operates on
12-volt direct current. Its length is 43 inches and its gauge is
3&frac12; inches.</p>
<p>The New York Central System purchased 10 class T-3A
locomotives in late 1926 at a cost of $100,000 each. These
supplemented an earlier group of 10 T-1&rsquo;s and 16 T-2&rsquo;s
built for the New York Central from 1913 to 1917 at the
Erie, Pa., plant of the General Electric Co. Of this total of
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
36 locomotives only one, <i>No. 270</i> (formerly <i>No. 1170</i>), had
been stricken from the records as of December 1954. The
remaining 35 still perform routine passenger service between
New York and Harmon, and New York and North White
Plains. The numbers in the group now run from 247 to 282
(formerly 1147 to 1182), with the exception of the scrapped
<i>No. 270</i>.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 75.&mdash;Operable model of General Electric locomotive, 1926.</p>
</div>
<p>With an operating weight of 292,600 pounds, the locomotives
of the T-3A class develop 1,908 horsepower continuously,
with a tractive force of 12,750 pounds, and they can
develop 2,488 horsepower for 1 hour, with a tractive force
of 18,440 pounds. The maximum speed of a T-3A is 75 miles
an hour. These locomotives operate on 660-volt direct current,
usually obtained from a third rail. The pantographs
are used only when crossing certain complicated crossover
switches. Each of the eight axles is driven by its individual
gearless motor. The overall wheelbase is 46 feet, 5 inches,
the overall length 56 feet, 10 inches.</p>
<h4 title="">B &amp; O Hudson-Type Locomotive Lord Baltimore, 1935</h4>
<p>During the winter of 1936-1937, The Baltimore and Ohio
Railroad Co. conducted in conjunction with the magazine
&ldquo;The Model Craftsman&rdquo; a contest among model builders for
the construction of a model of the railroad&rsquo;s Washington-to-Jersey
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
City lightweight, streamlined train, the &ldquo;Royal Blue,&rdquo;
first placed in operation on June 24, 1935.</p>

<p class="pcap">Figure 76.&mdash;Model of B &amp; O Hudson-type locomotive <i>Lord Baltimore</i>, 1935.</p>
</div>
<p>The contest, with a first prize of $500, was won by Fletcher
G. Speed of New Rochelle, N. Y., and his prize-winning train
(<a href="#fig76">figure 76</a>) was presented by the Baltimore and Ohio in 1937
to the National Museum (USNM 311191). The train consists
of the Hudson-type, or 4-6-4, steam locomotive <i>Lord
Baltimore</i> and tender, together 2 feet long, plus five cars.
Beautiful in workmanship, and powered with a small electric
motor, the model is built to a scale of &frac14; inch to the foot.</p>
<p>The original locomotive <i>Lord Baltimore</i> was designed by
the Baltimore and Ohio, and was constructed at the company&rsquo;s
Mount Clare shops in Baltimore. The weight of the
locomotive and tender in working order was 527,000 pounds,
and the tractive force was 38,000 pounds. The driving
wheels were 84 inches in diameter, and the driving wheelbase
was 178 inches. The bore and stroke of the cylinders
were 20 and 28 inches, respectively, Walschaert valve gear
was used, and a steam pressure of 350 pounds per square
inch was employed. The fuel was bituminous coal.</p>
<p>On September 11, 1935, an average speed of 59.28 miles
an hour was obtained between Washington and Jersey City
while pulling a dynamometer car and five other cars.
Although designated as <i>No. 2</i> when built in 1935, the locomotive
was changed to <i>No. 5340</i> in 1942. As it was not
designed to handle standard weight trains, the locomotive
was later removed from service, and after being in storage
for several years was scrapped on July 19, 1949.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h4 title="">Lima Northern-Type Locomotive, 1937</h4>
<p>A black, red, and orange nonoperable model (<a href="#fig77">figure 77</a>)
in the collection represents the Southern Pacific Co. <i>No. 4410</i>,
the first of the many such streamlined 4-8-4, or Northern-type,
steam locomotives built for that line. This model of
<i>No. 4410</i> and its tender, about 27 inches long, is built to the
scale of &frac14; inch to the foot. The gift of the Southern Pacific
Co. in 1937, it was made early in that year especially for the
Museum&rsquo;s collection (USNM 311340).</p>
<p>The first group of this type of streamliner, which was the
conception of George McCormick and Frank E. Russell of
the Southern Pacific, was completed by the Lima Locomotive
Works in January 1937. The first run with one of these
streamliners was made on March 21 with the &ldquo;Coast Daylight&rdquo;
passenger train between San Francisco and Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>Of the total of 50 essentially similar locomotives of this
streamlined class, the Southern Pacific still had 49 in November
1954, only <i>No. 4414</i> having been authorized for
scrapping. At that time, these locomotives had averaged
approximately 13,000 miles a month since being placed in
service, although many had completed over 15,000 miles in
particularly productive months. The earlier ones, represented
by this model, developed 4,500 horsepower at 55
miles an hour and had a top speed of 90 miles an hour,
although 75 was the highest allowable operating speed. They
were able to maintain a 9&frac34;-hour schedule between San
Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The locomotive and tender are 108 feet long, and weigh
835,000 pounds in operating condition. The fuel is bunker
type C oil. A boiler pressure of 250 pounds per square inch
is employed. The cylinder bore is 27 inches, the stroke 30.
The eight drivers are 73 inches in diameter, and the driving
wheelbase is 20 feet. The later streamlined 4-8-4&rsquo;s of the
Southern Pacific develop 5,500 horsepower at 55 miles an
hour, and operate on a boiler pressure of 300 pounds per
square inch.</p>
<h4 title="">General Electric Locomotive, 1938</h4>
<p>A nonoperable model (<a href="#fig78">figure 78</a>) of the first of six
2-C+C-2 streamlined electric locomotives built by the
General Electric Co. for The New York, New Haven and
Hartford Railroad Co. was made especially for the Museum
collection (USNM 311880) by the builder of these locomotives.
The model, constructed in the Bridgeport, Conn., plant
of the General Electric Co. and presented to the Museum in
1940, is of plaster painted green and black, with gold trim. It
is 31 inches long and has a gauge of 1&frac34; inches.</p>
<p>The electric locomotives represented by this model were
built in 1938 at the Erie, Pa., plant of the General Electric
Co. for passenger service between New Haven and New
York. Originally numbered from 0361 to 0366, they are now
numbered from 360 to 365.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>On the New Haven tracks these 77-foot-long locomotives
operate on 11,000-volt, single-phase, 25-cycle, alternating
current obtained from an overhead trolley system. On the
New York Central tracks they operate on 660-volt direct
current obtained usually from a third rail, but occasionally
from an overhead supply at some crossover switches. For this
latter purpose a small auxiliary pantograph is used. Control
equipment is, of course, provided for both types of power
supply.</p>
<p>The fully loaded weight is 433,200 pounds, of which
272,400 pounds is on the twelve 56-inch drivers. While operating
on alternating current, the continuous tractive force is
24,100 pounds, and the continuously available horsepower
3,600. The maximum available horsepower from the six
twin-armature, 12-pole motors is 7,600. Slightly different
results are obtained while operating on direct current. The
maximum safe speed is 93 miles an hour.</p>
<h4 title="">American Locomotive Co. Hudson-Type Locomotive, 1938</h4>
<p>Development of the original Hudson-type locomotives
began in 1926 when the New York Central System decided
it needed a new type of passenger locomotive to meet the
demands of high-speed, long-distance runs. The type was
named after the river along which it would run. In late 1937
and in 1938, 50 Hudsons of an improved design, built by the
American Locomotive Co., were placed on the New York
Central. These locomotives, Nos. 5405 to 5454, had larger
boilers than their predecessors, had greater tractive force,
and were fitted with roller bearings. In addition, Nos. 5445
to 5454 were streamlined.</p>
<p>A nonoperable model (<a href="#fig79">figure 79</a>) in the Museum collection
(USNM 313162), gift of the New York Central System
in 1947, represents <i>No. 5429</i>. The model locomotive and
tender are 2 feet long and are accompanied by a train of six
streamlined cars. The entire train is painted silver, with
black trimming on the locomotive and tender. Built to a
scale of &frac14; inch to the foot, it was especially made for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
Museum, the builder being Edwin P. Alexander of Yardley,
Pa.</p>
<div class="img" id="ill80">

<p class="pcap">Figure 79.&mdash;Model of American Locomotive Co. Hudson-type locomotive, 1938.</p>
</div>
<p>The original <i>No. 5429</i>, constructed in 1938, was streamlined
in 1941 in the West Albany shops of the New York
Central, and in December of that year was placed back in
service on the Empire State Express with an entirely new
streamlined train of specially designed stainless-steel cars.
When the Empire State Express was ultimately dieselized in
1945, <i>No. 5429</i> was put to other uses, and the streamlining
was removed in 1950. As of October 1955 it was still in
service.</p>
<p>In streamlined condition, as represented by the model, the
locomotive and tender together weighed 681,900 pounds
and their length was a few inches over 97 feet. The diameter
of the driving wheels was 79 inches, the bore and stroke of
the cylinders were 22&frac12; and 29 inches, respectively, and the
total tractive force was 53,960 pounds. A steam pressure of
265 pounds per square inch was used.</p>
<h4 title="">Baldwin-Westinghouse Geared Steam-Turbine Locomotive, 1944</h4>
<p>A radical departure from the usual design for a coal-burning
steam locomotive, and the first of its type built in this
country, was the noncondensing geared steam-turbine locomotive
built jointly by The Baldwin Locomotive Works and
the Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. Constructed
in 1944 at Baldwin&rsquo;s Eddystone plant (Westinghouse
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
manufactured the turbines and gears), it was designated
Pennsylvania Railroad Co. class S-2 locomotive
<i>No. 6200</i>.</p>
<p>This locomotive, combining the work of two pioneers in
the railroad equipment field, is represented in the Museum
collection by a nonoperable model (<a href="#fig80">figure 80</a>) made especially
for the Museum (USNM 312935) and presented to it
by The Baldwin Locomotive Works early in 1946. The locomotive
and tender, together 30 inches long, were built to a
scale of &frac14; inch to the foot by Minton Cronkhite of Pasadena,
Calif.</p>
<p>Two steam turbines, similar to the type that drive the
larger fighting ships of the U.S. Navy, powered the original
locomotive. The more complex and powerful of the two, the
forward-drive turbine, developed a maximum of 7,250
horsepower and was at all times engaged with the wheels.
(Although 6,500 horsepower has usually been the quoted
figure for the forward-drive turbine, 7,250 was actually developed
on October 22, 1946, at the Altoona Locomotive
Testing Plant.) The simpler one, for reverse only, developed
1,500 horsepower and was normally disengaged from the
driving wheels except while actually being used.</p>
<p>The boiler, frame, trucks, and driving wheels were of the
conventional type, the most notable visible difference between
the locomotive and those of other types being the
absence of cylinders, valve motion, and their accompanying
parts. Because of the elimination of piston rods and other
reciprocating parts it was possible to balance almost perfectly
the driving wheels, thus permitting a higher operating
speed than normally practical with a conventional locomotive.</p>
<p>The weight of the locomotive alone was 580,000 pounds,
and its forward tractive force was 70,500 pounds. A 6-8-6
wheel arrangement was employed, the driving wheel diameter
was 68 inches, and a speed of 100 miles an hour was
possible. The working steam pressure was 310 pounds per
square inch. Bituminous coal served as the fuel. A detailed
and well illustrated description of this locomotive appears
in the magazine &ldquo;Baldwin&rdquo; (for the fourth quarter of 1944).</p>
<p>The locomotive covered 103,050 miles in passenger service,
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
and was then set aside on June 11, 1949, because it was in
need of repairs to the firebox and flues, and also to the
turbines, oil pumps, and gears. At that time all passenger
service on the Pennsylvania was being changed to diesel-electric
operation, so the locomotive was ultimately scrapped
on May 29, 1952.</p>

<h4 title="">General Motors Diesel-Electric Locomotive, 1945</h4>
<p>A nonoperable model of a diesel-electric locomotive (<a href="#fig81">figure 81</a>)
was given to the Museum (USNM 313163) by the
New York Central System in 1947. This gray and black
model, which is 33 inches long and is built to a scale of &frac14;
inch to the foot, represents the General Motors 2-unit diesel-electric
<i>No. 4000-4001</i> of the New York Central, a type
placed in service with the Empire State Express in 1945 to
replace the Hudson-type steam locomotives described on
<a href="#Page_99">page 99</a>. The model was especially built for the Museum&rsquo;s
collection, the builder being Edwin P. Alexander of Yardley,
Pa.</p>
<p>The overall length of the two full sized units is just over
140 feet and their combined weight is 646,000 pounds.
Each end of each unit is supported by a 6-wheeled truck,
and the wheel diameter is 36 inches throughout.</p>
<p>Each unit is equipped with two General Motors 12-cylinder
V-type 2-cycle diesel engines having a bore of 8&frac12; inches
and a stroke of 10 inches, and developing 1,000 horsepower
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
at 800 revolutions per minute, a total of 4,000 horsepower for
the two units combined. Each engine is directly coupled to a
generator that supplies direct current to the two traction
motors, geared, respectively, to the front and rear axles of its
corresponding truck. No power is applied to the center axle,
which is for weight distribution only. The joint tractive force
of the two units is 108,950 pounds.</p>

<h2 id="c16">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
<p>The author wishes to express his appreciation for the help
given him by the many individuals, including railroad
officials, librarians, and museum curators, who provided
answers to many questions and confirmed many conjectures.</p>
<p>Special thanks are tendered A. B. Lawson and Lawrence
W. Sagle of The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Co., F. V.
Koval of the Chicago and North Western Railway System,
W. F. Kascal and Harry B. Spurrier of the New York Central
System, H. T. Cover of the Pennsylvania Railroad Co.,
Harry E. Hammer of the Reading Co., K. C. Ingram of the
Southern Pacific Co., Elizabeth O. Cullen of the Association
of American Railroads, D. M. MacMaster of the Museum
of Science and Industry at Chicago, H. D. Watson of
the University of Maine, George M. Hart of George School
in Bucks County, Pa., and Robert R. Brown of Lachine,
Quebec&mdash;to name a few of those whose contributions have
helped bring together the facts here presented.</p>
<p>It is fitting also at this time to refer to the late Charles B.
Chaney, who collected over a period of almost 60 years an
immense number of photographs, negatives, drawings, lithographs,
and books dealing with railroading. Upon his death
in 1948, he left this entire collection to the United States
National Museum, of the Smithsonian Institution, confident
that in the Museum it would be put to the widest possible use
and would, therefore, carry forward his lifelong work of
research in the history of locomotives and railroads.</p>
<p>His confidence was well founded. The Chaney collection
of railroad material has been an invaluable source of
information for the present work.</p>
<p>To acknowledge the contribution of Thomas Norrell of
Silver Spring, Md., is likewise a pleasure. He graciously
consented to read the manuscript of this work, and his
authoritative comments have greatly enhanced its comprehensiveness
and accuracy.</p>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_2" href="#fr_2">[2]</a>Davis and Gartner have an earlier claim to engineering fame, for in conjunction
with John Elgar they had constructed in York, in 1825, the first American-built
vessel with a metal hull, the sheet-iron steamboat <i>Codorus</i>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_3" href="#fr_3">[3]</a>Although he spelled his name Gartner, and it appears in that form in the early
annual reports of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road Co., and in all subsequent histories
of that road, his tombstone (in lot 34, section H of the Prospect Hill Cemetery
in York, Pa.) bears the name in its Anglicized form, Israel Gardner.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_4" href="#fr_4">[4]</a>The correct name of the builder of the <i>Rocket</i>, according to Dendy Marshall, was
Braithwaite, Milner and Co. The two brass maker&rsquo;s plates on the opposite sides of
the front of the locomotive&rsquo;s boiler read &ldquo;Braithwaite &amp; Co./ London./ March
1838.&rdquo; However, as they are of the same size and shape as the shop plates of the
Philadelphia and Reading in the early 1890&rsquo;s, and as there was no plate on the locomotive
in the late 1880&rsquo;s (see <a href="#fig51">figure 51</a>), it is quite likely that these plates are not
original with the locomotive. They were probably made and installed at the time
it was refurbished for exhibition at Chicago in 1893.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_5" href="#fr_5">[5]</a>Railroads are known not to have existed in Mexico prior to 1850, and although
locomotives of the 1825-1849 period could possibly have found their way into that
country at some later date, none are to be found there today, according to advice
from the Mexican National Railways (Ferrocarriles Nacionales de Mexico). Central
America falls outside the scope of this work, as do the Islands of the Caribbean.
However, a railroad was opened in Cuba in 1837, and another was started across
the Isthmus of Panama in 1849 and completed in 1855 (its first locomotive was received
soon after the midcentury mark had been passed), so there is the remote
possibility that somewhere in this area the remains of a pre-1850 locomotive could
exist.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or

Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
